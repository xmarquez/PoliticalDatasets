Afghanistan (1929-73)	"Start: 10/10/1929 Tribal forces led by Nadir Khan and his brothers seized Kabul after defeating the insurgent who had ousted the previous hereditary monarch, a distant relative of Nadir. The dynasty began October 16, 1929 when Nadir Khan was crowned (Baxter 1997; Herb 1997, 284)."	"End: 7/17/1973 Coup deposed the monarch (Baxter 1997; Encyclopedia of World Biography 2011)."
Afghanistan (1973-78)	"Start: 7/17/1973 Coup led by Mohammed Daoud Khan, with support from leftist junior officers and the Parcham faction of the PDPA (Communist Party), deposed the monarchy and replaced it with a new ruling group. Parcham's influence after the coup was limited from the beginning, and they were eliminated from the ruling group by the end of 1975 (Baxter 1997)."	"End: 4/27/1978 Coup by a faction of the army allied with the Communists ousted Daoud (Baxter 1997)."
Afghanistan (1978-92)	"Start: 4/27/1978 Coup by a faction of the army allied with the PDPA (Communists), established a ruling Revolutionary Council originally of 58 members, dominated by the Khalq faction of the PDPA (Baxter 1997; Newell 1997)."	"End: 4/16/1992 The fall of Kabul; Najibullah government ousted by the Mujaheddin insurgency (Rais 1993, 910; Ewans 2001, 178). [Afghanistan 1993-96 is excluded from the data set because of warlordism, chaos, no effective central government.]"
Afghanistan (1996-2001)	"Start: 9/27/1996 Taliban capture of Kabul; they established a government over most of the country (BBC News 1996)"	"End: 11/13/2001 U.S. invasion began on October 7 2001, with the defeat of Taliban government in Kabul on November 13 2001 (Economist Intelligence Unit 2008a, 8; U.S. State Department 2011a)."
Afghanistan (2009-)	"Start: 8/20/2009 Fraudulent presidential elections are identified as the event that marked the independence of the Karzai government from U.S. influence (Tristram 2009)"	"End: Karzai regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Albania (1944-91)	"Start: 11/29/1944 occupation of Tirane by the National Liberation Movement (later Front) forces led by Hoxha, after the defeat of anti-communist resistance forces and the withdrawal of Italian and German occupying forces. The NLM had set up a provisional government, the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation, led by Hoxha, a few months before in the territories it controlled. The occupation of Tirane marks its control of most of the country (Sudetic 1992; Pearson 2006, 221)."	"End: 6/1/1991 Resignation of the Communist-dominated National Assembly in response to a popular uprising. Demonstrations and strikes led to the government's resignation, the transfer of power to a coalition government to handle the transition, and Alia's loss of all but formal power. The first multiparty elections occurred in March 1991, but were won by the Party of Labor (communists) and thus aren't coded as transitional. Beginning in May 1991, hundreds of thousands of citizens participated in strikes and demonstrations to demand that the communists step down. A transitional government led by the opposition established a new electoral law in February 1992 and oversaw competitive elections in March 1992, which were won by the opposition, completing the transition (Global Nonviolent Action Database 2011; Economist Intelligence Unit 1997; Global Security 2011b)."
Algeria (1962-92)	"Start: 7/3/1962 Independence with the FLN, which had led the fight for independence, in control; it established a provisional government, which quickly became permanent (Toth 1994; Political Handbook of the World 2012a, 24)."	"End: 1/11/1992 Military coup. Benjedid was replaced by the High Council of State, and the constitution was suspended (Metz 1994; Ruedy 2005, 256,260). Although the military had been an important pillar of the pre-1992 regime, the post-1992 period is considered a different regime because for the first several years after the coup the FLN, which had been the ruling party, was excluded from influence and office (Toth 1994; Bouandel 2003, 13; Ruedy 2005, 256,260)."
Algeria (1992-)	"Start: 1/11/1992 Military coup ousted Benjedid, closed the Assembly, suspended the constitution, and reformed the High Council of State to become the country's ruling body (Toth 1994; Ruedy 2005, 256,260)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Angola (1975-)	"Start: 11/11/1975 Independence, with Luanda and a substantial part of the country controlled by the MPLA, which had led the fight for independence; it established a government in the part of the country it controlled (Warner 1989)."

Argentina (1943-1946)	"Start: 6/4/1943 Coup led by Gen Ramirez ousted the oligarchic civilian government and established a military junta (Potash 1961, 573)."	"End: 2/24/1946 Competitive election, generally considered to be fair, ended rule by the military (Lewis 1990, 98-99)."
Argentina (1951-55)	"Start: 9/28/1951 This date marks declaration of internal warfare by the elected Peronist government, which suspended constitutional guarantees and allowed detention without trial. The date marks when the incremental "authoritarianization" of the regime crossed the line to dictatorship. In the months preceding the November 1951 election, the government had pursued a strategy of harassment and manipulation against the opposition, but at the end of September, they began arresting opposition leaders and excluded opposition deputies from the legislature shortly afterward, completing the transition to dictatorship (Ilsley 1952, 229, 240; Potash 1980, 133; Brooker 1995, 175)."	"End: 9/16/1955 Coup ousted Peron (Potash 1961, 575; Brooker 1995, 181; Lewis 2001, 110-11)."
Argentina (1955-58)	"Start: 9/16/1955 Coup led by Gen Lonardi ousted the Peronist government and established a military junta (Potash 1961, 575; Lewis 2001, 110-11)."	"End: 2/23/1958 Election ended direct military rule. The election was competitive but the largest party, the PJ, was banned (O'Donnell 1973, 166-92; Potash 1980, 228)."
Argentina (1958-66)	"Start: 2/23/1958 The February election in which the largest party, the PJ, was banned marks the transition from direct to indirect military rule. A civilian was elected and occupied the presidency, but the military exercised active veto power over economic policy and the choice of ministers as well as prohibited the participation of the Peronist Party in elections (O'Donnell 1973, 166-92; Finer 1975, 153). Consequently we code the period from February 1958 to June 1966 as authoritarian and as indirect military rule."	"End: 6/28/1966 Coup ousted the civilian government, ending indirect military rule, and replaced it with direct military rule (Gallo 1969, 497-98, 501)."
Argentina (1966-73)	"Start: 6/28/1966 Coup led by Lt-Gen Pistarini, the commander-in-chief, ousted the civilian president and replaced indirect with direct military rule (Gallo 1969, 501; Potash 1996, 160-61)."	"End: 3/11/1973 The March 1973 presidential election was competitive, free and fair, and the Peronist party was allowed to run and win (Arceneaux 2001, 68; Lewis 2001, 149-51)."
Argentina (1976-83)	"Start: 3/24/1976 Coup led by Gen Videla ousted the democratic government and established a military junta to rule (U.S. State Department 2011b)."	"End: 10/30/1983 October election was competitive, free and fair, marking the transition to democracy (Rock 1995, 389; Arceneaux 2001, 114-40)."
Armenia (1994-98)	"Start: 12/31/1994 This is the date when the elected Ter-Petrosian government crossed the line between democracy and dictatorship. In December it suspended the largest opposition party (Dashnak, HHD) to prevent its participation in the July 1995 parliamentary election, and in subsequent months it disqualified multiple other parties and more than a third of the candidates (Bremmer and Welt 1997, 86-87; Political Handbook of the World 2012b, 66)."	"End: 2/4/1998 Ter-Petrosian and many other high officials of the HHSh resigned in response to massive public protests and loss of support by important political elites, leading to the accession to power of the Kocharian government Libaridian 2006, 9-10. Kocharian's government is coded as a different regime because of a change in the identity of the group from which top leaders could be selected. Ter-Petrosian's coalition originally included nearly all non-communist Armenians, though it narrowed over time. Since the accession of Kocharian, the leadership has been dominated by individuals from Nagorno Karabakh; the HHSh is no longer in government and scarcely exists (Middle East Journal 1998, 415-39; Usher 1999, 20)."
Armenia (1998-)	"Start: 2/4/1998 Accession to power by Kocharian and the Nagorno Karabakh faction after resignations by Ter-Petrosian and many other high officials of HHSh in response to massive public protests. Kocharian's government is coded as a different regime because of a change in the identity of the group from which top leaders could be selected. Ter-Petrosian's coalition originally included nearly all non-communist Armenians; it narrowed over time but always included people from multiple regions. Since the accession of Kocharian, the leadership has been dominated by individuals from Nagorno Karabakh (Middle East Journal 1998, 415-39; Usher 1999, 20; Libaridian 2006, 9-10; Economist Intelligence Unit 2008b)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Azerbaijan (1991-92)	"Start: 10/18/1991 Independence under the leadership of the Communist Party and Mutalibov (Nichol 1994; Political Handbook of the World 2012c, 90)."	"End: 5/15/1992 A popular uprising ousted Mutalibov, leading to control by the National Assembly, which contained about half communist successor deputies and half opposition (PFA) deputies. It scheduled a competitive election in June 1992, which was won by the PFA, completing the transition (Altstadt 1992, 107-09; Political Handbook of the World 2012c, 90)."
Azerbaijan (1993-)	"Start: 6/16/1993 This is the date the elected president fled the capital in the face of rebellion by a faction of the military; we code it as the date of the victory of the rebels over the elected government. The leader of the military rebellion agreed to allow a civilian, Aliyev, who had been "elected" speaker of parliament in order to facilitate a "constitutional" succession, to replace the ousted president, while the military leader became PM in the new government (Nichol 1994; Political Handbook of the World 2012c, 92)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Bangladesh (1971-75)	"Start: 12/16/1971 This is the date the war of independence ended, marking the beginning of the regime. At independence Bangladesh was controlled by the Awami League led by Sheik Mujib. Although the Awami League had been an electoral party in Pakistan before its breakup, the Mujib government never allowed opposition or held fair elections (Blood 1988; Political Handbook of the World 2012d, 107-08)"	"End: 8/15/1975 Coup by a faction of young officers, who were themselves ousted a few months later ((Blood 1988); Political Handbook of the World 2012d, 108)."
Bangladesh (1975-82)	"Start: 11/6/1975 Coup led by socialist officers along with a mutiny by NCOs ousted the prior military government (that had only held power for a few days) and killed or arrested senior officers. The governments installed by previous coups on August 15, 1975 and November 3, 1975 are not included in the data set because they did not last past Jan 1, 1976 (Blood 1988)."	"End: 3/24/1982 Coup led by Gen. Ershad, Army Chief of Staff, ousted the BNP government that had succeeded Zia after his assassination (Blood 1988; Political Handbook of the World 2012d, 108)."
Bangladesh (1982-90)	"Start: 3/24/1982 Coup led by Lt Gen Ershad, army chief of staff, established a martial law government (Blood 1988; Political Handbook of the World 2012d)."	"End: 12/6/1990 Ershad ousted by popular protests and general strikes (Maniruzzaman 1992, 207-08). Fair, competitive elections in February 1991 completed a transition to democracy."
Bangladesh (2007-08)	"Start: 1/11/2007 State of emergency declared by the civilian caretaker government, which then resigned; because the military supported the intervention and controlled events behind the scenes, this event is coded as a coup. The military installed a different, non-political civilian government (Alamgir 2009, 47; Political Handbook of the World 2012d, 109)."	"End: 12/29/2008 Competitive election, winning party allowed to take power (Alamgir 2009, 41; Taylor and Robb 2012; Political Handbook of the World 2012d, 110)"
Belarus (1991-94)	"Start: 8/25/1991 Independence under the leadership of the Supreme Soviet elected before independence in elections from which the most important opposition was excluded (Zaprudnik and Fedor 1995)."	"End: 7/10/1994 Competitive presidential election (second round on July 10), which was not won by the government candidate (Korosteleva 1998, 35-45)."
Belarus (1994-)	"Start: 7/21/1994 Authoritarianization shortly after Lukashenka (or Lukashenko) was elected in a fair and competitive election. One of his first acts was postponing parliamentary elections, leaving in office those elected to the Supreme Soviet in 1990. Harassment of the opposition began within days of his election (Silitski 2003, 44-46)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Benin (1960-63)	"Start: 12/11/1960 The 1960 election is identified as the endpoint of a series of political manipulations that resulted in the exclusion of a party representing about 30 percent of voters from representation: two out of three regionally based parties merged to exclude the third and guarantee themselves a majority; they then changed the electoral rules to winner-take-all in one national district, aiming to permanently exclude the minority party from representation and spoils. In the month before the election several opposition deputies were dismissed from parliament, and opposition party activists were harassed, further limiting their ability to compete. In April-May 1961, repression intensified. The opposition party was dissolved, and its leaders arrested (Carter 1963, 229-31; Mathews 1966, 144; Decalo 1973, 458; Ronen 1973, 27-28)."	"End: 10/28/1963 Massive demonstrations, general strike led army to take control and replace one civilian with another (Decalo 1973, 458-59; Decalo 1976, 52)."
Benin (1963-65)	"Start: 10/28/1963 Massive demonstrations and a general strike led the army to take control and appoint a new government (Decalo 1976, 52)."	"End: 12/22/1965 Coup led by Gen. Soglo, Army Chief of Staff, against the provisional government under the speaker of the National Assembly (Decalo 1973, 459-60; Decalo 1976, 58)."
Benin (1965-67)	"Start: 12/22/1965 Coup, led by Gen Soglo, army chief of staff, established military rule (Decalo 1973, 459-60; Decalo 1976, 58)."	"End: 12/17/1967 Coup by junior officers ousted Soglo. The post-1967 regime is considered different from the 1963-65 regime because a government of a military faction dominated by top officers mostly from the South was replaced by a government dominated by lower ranked officers, mostly from the North (Decalo 1973, 460-64; Decalo 1976, 64-66)."
Benin (1967-69)	"Start: 12/17/1967 Coup by junior officers replaced Soglo. They created the Military Revolutionary Committee of 3 capts, 8 lieuts, and 3 NCOs, as a decision-making body, but the main decisions were made by an informal junta (Bebler 1973, 23). Coded as a different regime because the coup and subsequent purges changed the ethnic, regional, and rank composition of the group from which leaders could be chosen and who could influence policy (Bebler 1973, 20-23; Decalo 1973, 464; Decalo 1976, 55, 64-66)."	"End: 12/10/1969 Zinsou, the civilian president appointed by the military, proved to be less subservient than expected, and Kouandete ordered him kidnapped. The rest of the officer corps refused to support Kouandete as government leader, but replaced Zinsou with a Military Directorate responsible to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that included representatives of the major regions and factions. Kouandete was included but his powers were reduced; he was no longer the dominant member (Bebler 1973, 25; Decalo 1973, 469-70; Decalo 1976, 72). The post-1969 period is considered a different regime because of the exclusion of civilian allies and a change in the regional base of the military leaders (Decalo 1976, 73)."
Benin (1969-70)	"Start: 12/13/1969 A Military Directorate responsible to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces replaced Zinsou/Kouandete. Coded as a different regime because the regional/ethnic and rank composition of the ruling group changed. Fon officers who had been retired or arrested during the previous regime were rehabilitated and given influential roles in the new regime (Decalo 1976, 72-73)."	"End: 5/7/1970 The military turned power over to an un-elected civilian Presidential Council representing the three major regionally based leaders and parties in the country. The Presidential Council was to serve as a transitional body with the presidency to rotate among the three leaders in preparation for new democratic elections. The military did withdraw from politics, and members of the Presidential Council carried out the rules agreed to, including rotating the presidency (Decalo 1973, 470- 76; Decalo 1976, 76-77). Democratization did not ultimately occur, but it was not prevented by the leaders of the 1969-70 regime. [The period from May 1970 to October 1972 is excluded from the data set as a provisional government expected to lead to a planned transition to democracy.]"
Benin (1972-90)	"Start: 10/26/1972 Coup, led by Maj Kerekou and junior officers, ousted the civilian transitional government and replaced the entire senior military establishment; they established the Military Committee for the Revolution to rule (Decalo 1973, 476-77; Decalo 1976, 79-80)."	"End: 2/25/1990 We date the end of the regime from the opening of the National Conference that reduced Kerekou to a figurehead. Strikes and demonstrations from late 1989 to mid 1990 forced the Kerekou government to agree to a National Conference, which transformed itself into a transitional interim government (Soble 2007). Although Kerekou remained president, we coded the regime end in 1990 because observers describe his power as having been quite reduced, he gave up the Defense Ministry (and had previously resigned from the military), and military provincial prefects were replaced by civilians. The transitional government was led by the opposition, rewrote the constitution, and held a competitive election lost by the incumbent in two rounds of presidential elections on March 10 and March 24 1991 (Africa Contemporary Record 1991; Englebert 2004a, 67-68)."
Bolivia (1943-46)	"Start: 12/20/1943 Coup by nationalist junior officers organized as "secret" lodges, allied with the MNR, brought to power a junta led by Maj Villarroel (Canberra Times 1943; Klein 1969, 368-70; Corbett 1972, 403). The MNR was excluded from the cabinet from 3/44-12/44 in response to US pressure, but remained allied with government and politically important (Klein 1969, 373)."	"End: 7/21/1946. Violent popular uprising, Villarroel hung from lamppost (Klein 1969, 382; Corbett 1972, 403) ."
Bolivia (1946-51)	"Start: 7/21/1946 Popular ouster of Villarroel led to a civilian transitional government and competitive elections in January 1947 (Klein 1969, 382). This period is coded as oligarchic, and thus authoritarian, because suffrage limitations on illiterates prevented much of the population from voting. In 1951, Klein (1969, 404) estimates 7% of population, or 28% of adult males, were able to vote."	"End: 5/16/1951 Limited participation election results annulled; power handed over to military to prevent the winner of the election from taking office (Klein 1969, 399-400; Alexander 1982, 178-79)."
Bolivia (1951-52)	"Start: 5/16/1951 Power handed to the military under Gen Ballivian and election annulled (Klein 1969, 399-400; Alexander 1982, 178-79)."	"End: 4/9/1952 Armed rebellion led by the MNR defeated the military regime (Corbett 1972, 403)."
Bolivia (1952-64)	"Start: 4/9/1952 Armed rebellion led by the MNR defeated the military and placed Paz Estenssoro, the winner of the 1951 limited suffrage election, in the presidency. Suffrage was extended to illiterates before the next election, but this regime is not coded as democratic because of the mass exile of opposition political leaders and other MNR actions "authoritarianized" it. Initially, violence against the opposition was carried out by workers' militias allied with the MNR and peasant land invasions not controlled by the central government, but the government itself also became more repressive as the opposition responded to violence with violence, and the government responded to them with the creation of political police and banishment of opponents to concentration camps (Malloy 1971, 124-31; Corbett 1972, 403)."	"End: 11/4/1964. Coup led by Gen. Barrientos ousted the MNR government (Corbett 1972, 408-10)."
Bolivia (1964-69)	"Start: 11/4/1964 Coup led by Gen Barrientos leading a faction of the military established a new ruling group (Corbett 1972, 408-10; Wagner 1989)."	"End: 9/26/1969 Coup ousted the civilian vice president who succeeded Gen. Barrientos, who died in a plane crash (Corbett 1972, 416). Although Barrientos was an officer, his government had been substantially civilianized."
Bolivia (1969-71)	"Start: 9/26/1969 Coup led by Gen Ovando led to a regime controlled by the Superior Council of the Armed Forces with a rotating chair (Corbett 1972, 416-19). The post- 1969 period is considered a different regime because it excluded Barrientos' civilian allies from influence on the choice of leaders and policies and included a broader array of military factions."	"End: 8/21/1971 Coup led by Col. Banzer (exiled ex-officer) allied with the MNR, the FSB, and a rightist faction of the military ousted a military-led government supported by different military factions and allied with different groups of civilians (Corbett 1972, 424; Wagner 1989)."
Bolivia (1971-79)	"Start: 8/21/1971 Coup led by Col Banzer (exiled ex-officer) allied with the MNR, the FSB, and a rightist faction of the military established a new ruling group (Corbett 1972, 424; Wagner 1989)."	"End: 7/1/1979 Fair competitive election after the military's decision to return to barracks. No candidate won a majority, which required Congress to choose the president. Congress deadlocked and eventually chose the head of the Senate as interim president until a second election to be held in 1980. The military seized power again brie y in November 1979, but after 16 days of a general strike and bloodshed, negotiated stepping down on condition that Congress name a different interim president to oversee the transition. Congress chose the president of the Chamber of Deputies. New elections were held as scheduled in June 1980 (Alexander 1982, 114-16; Wagner 1989). [The period from July 1979 to July 1980 is excluded from the data set as a provisional government overseeing a transition to democracy.]"
Bolivia (1980-82)	"Start: 7/17/1980 Coup led by Gen Garcia Meza established a government led by a military faction allied with the drug trade (Wagner 1989)."	"End: 10/10/1982 In the midst of a massive general strike, the military transferred power to the civilian government that had been democratically elected in 1980 but not allowed to take office (Wagner 1989)."
Botswana (1966-)	"Start: 9/30/1966 Independence under Seretse Khama and the BDP, which won 80% of the vote and 28/31 seats in a competitive election before independence (Sillery 1974, 158-59). Botswana is often considered democratic but is included in the data set because of evidence of an unequal playing field despite competitive elections. The formal and informal rules guiding politics in Botswana have effectively limited competition. The assembly includes several members appointed by the ruling party. Districts are gerrymandered, and the BDP controls the electoral commission (Africa Confidential 2008, 7). The vote for Parliament chooses the president, who is the candidate supported by a majority of MPs. Presidents then select vice presidents from the Parliament. By tradition, when presidents are ready to retire, they step down and hand power to their vice presidents before the parliamentary election that formally chooses the next president. This norm has limited challenges to the dominant faction in the party because the new incumbent controls the resources deputies need to win the upcoming election (Sillery 1974, 186; Africa Confidential 2008, 7). The opposition had little access to media before independent newspapers began to be established in the late 1980s, and the government still maintains a substantial advantage through state-run media. The BDP has been able to monopolize appointments to the civil service and local tribal administration for Botswana's entire history, and thus to target spending to influence election outcomes (Mokopakgosi and Molomo 2000). The BDP has never held less than 2/3 of the seats in the Assembly during the more than five decades since independence. Mokopakgosi and Molomo (2000, 7) call Botswana a "defacto one-party state.""	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Brazil (1964-85)	"Start: 4/1/1964 Military coup ousted the elected government and established a military junta to rule (McCann 1997)."	"End: 1/15/1985 An electoral college, most of whom had been elected in fair, competitive elections, elected a civilian president from the opposition (New York Times 1985). A military-sponsored candidate lost the electoral college competition. The presidentelect died before inauguration but was constitutionally succeeded by the civilian vice president selected along with him by the electoral college, who was allowed to take office, and the military returned to the barracks. Although the new president had been a leader of the party that supported the military regime, he was a member of a faction that defected from the regime support party during the year prior to the transition, and he governed in coalition with the party that had led the opposition to the military government (Skidmore 1988, 250-60)."
Bulgaria (1944-90)	"Start: 9/9/1944 The Fatherland Front made up of Social Democrats, the Agrarian Union, Zveno (a nationalist group of officers), and the Communists seized the government immediately after the Soviet invasion. The communists did not dominate the coalition numerically, but were better organized and more disciplined. They secured the Interior and Justice Ministries in the new government, which enabled them to repress opponents. Thousands were executed and thousands sent to concentration camps during the first year. The Interior Ministry also gave the communists control of local government and the 1945 elections. Although the first PM was a Social Democrat, the communists were more effective in controlling events, and the regime had become unambiguously dominated by communists by the end of 1945 (Van Dyke 1947, 358-60, 364-69; Curtis 1992; Brunnbauer 2008, 52)."	"End: 8/1/1990 The National Assembly, still controlled by the BSP (renamed comAutocratic regime Start and End events 49 munist party), chose Zhelev, leader of the opposition UDF, as president after the communist leader Mladenov resigned. Zhelev was a compromise candidate; a nonpartisan PM was chosen in November 1990 to replace the BSP PM. This marks the end of the communist regime before new elections were held in 1991 and won by the UDF, completing the transition (Curtis 1992)."
Burkina Faso (1960-66)	"Start: 8/5/1960 Independence under single party rule; opposition parties were banned shortly before independence (Collier 1982, 109; Englebert 1996, 34-35). In December 1960 Yameogo, the new UDV/RDA president, prevented opposition parties from competing in municipal elections, and several opposition politicians were arrested (Englebert 1996, 44)."	"End: 1/3/1966 The military intervened at the unions' request, rather than firing on unarmed demonstrators during a general strike (Africa Confidential 1968a, 5; Englebert 1996, 46)."
Burkina Faso (1966-80)	"Start: 1/3/1966 The military, led by Chief of Staff Lt Col Lamizana, intervened at unions' request, rather than firing on unarmed demonstrators during a general strike. He suspended the constitution and created a new governing body, the Superior Council of the Armed Forces, of all officers ranked above capt (Africa Confidential 1968a, 5; Englebert 1996, 46). The regime was later broadened to included civilians."	"End: 11/25/1980 Coup led by Col. Zerbo overthrew General Lamizana and established the Comite Militaire de Redressement pour le Progres National. All key posts were granted to officers (Englebert 1996, 51-2). The 1966-80 regime is considered different from the earlier period because civilians were excluded from the ruling group."
Burkina Faso (1980-82)	"Start: 11/25/1980 Coup led by Col Zerbo established the Comite Militaire de Redressement pour le Progres National, which included 5 NCOs and one soldier as well as 25 officers, as the policy making body. The constitution was suspended and parties banned (Engelbert 1998, 51-52). The period from 1980-82 is considered a different regime because Lamizana's civilian coalition partners were excluded from the ruling group."	"End: 11/7/1982 Coup by junior officers and privates (Robinson 1992, 146; Englebert 1996, 53-54).

Burkina Faso (1982-87)	"Start: 11/7/1982 Coup dominated by junior officers. Col. Some, army commander, led the coup but was prevented from becoming president of the new regime by other armed factions led by junior officers who had participated in the coup (Englebert 1996, 53-54). The new government is treated as a different regime from Zerbo's because of a change in the rank of the group from which leaders could be chosen."	"End: 10/15/1987 Assassination of Sankara by soldiers linked to Compaore (Wilkins 1989, 375), followed by Compaore's accession to power, and the beginning of the change in the social and organizational bases of the regime. The government that began in 1987 is treated as a new regime because Compaore changed the identity of the groups that could influence policy and from which officials could be chosen. Leaders of the small parties that had collaborated with Sankara fled to exile, were repressed or merged into the new ruling single party, along with new parties representing some of the same political formations that had been excluded by Sankara after dominating politics in the sixties and seventies (Englebert 1996, 61-5). The CDRs were dissolved in early 1988. In short, the post-1987 regime included a much wider array of political actors but excluded some of those who had been important to Sankara's support base."
Burkina Faso (1987-)	"Start: 10/15/1987 Assassination of Sankara, leading to the creation of a broader, more moderate coalition government. The CDRs were dissolved in early 1988. The small leftist parties that had collaborated with Sankara fled to exile, were repressed or merged into the new ruling single party, ODP/MT, along with new parties representing some of the same political formations that had dominated politics in the sixties and seventies. A few of Sankara's military allies were executed. By 1990, the ruling FP included seven parties besides ODP/MT and most unions, which had been excluded by Sankara (Englebert 1996, 65). In short, the regime had been broadened to include a much wider array of political and socio-economic actors, and its leftism had been muted."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Burundi (1962-66)	"Start: 7/1/1962 Independence under the traditional monarchy, supposedly constitutional, but the crown chose and dismissed governments without consulting parliament, increased its powers in various ways, and entrusted key offices to family members. Governments were balanced between Tutsis and Hutus (Lemarchand 1966, 420-23; Political Handbook of the World 2012e, 205)."	"End: 7/8/1966. Coup replaced the king with his youngest son, reduced the monarch's powers, and formed a government headed by one of the coup leaders, Capt. Micombero, who became PM.

Burundi (1966-87)	"Start: 7/8/1966 Coup replaced the king with his youngest son, reduced the monarch's powers, and forced him to appoint the coup leader, Capt Micombero, as PM. A second coup in November 1966 by Tutsi military officers under PM Micombero resulted in the formal transition from monarchy to republic with Micombero in control and a government dominated by Tutsi officers and politicians. Hutus were purged from officer corps in 1966, 1969, and 1972, as well as from the bureaucracy and politics (Lemarchand 1974a, 75, Lemarchand 1974b, 87)."	"End: 9/3/1987. Coup led by Maj. Buyoya (Europa World Yearbook 2004, 946; Political Handbook of the World 2012e, 205). Buyoya's government is considered a new regime because he initially dissolved the Tutsi ruling party and established an allmilitary ruling group of 31 officers, thus changing the identity of the group able to influence policy."
Burundi (1987-93)	"Start: 9/3/1987 Coup led by Maj Buyoya, Tutsi, who initially established the all Tutsi Military Committee for National Salvation of 31 officers; in 10/88 the Council was reformed with half Tutsi, half Hutu members (Europa World Yearbook 2004, 946, Political Handbook of the World 2012e, 205)."

"End: 4/30/2003 Installation of an interim transitional government. Buyoya handed power to his Hutu VP as agreed to in the Arusha Peace Accord. The new president, Frodebu party leader Ndayizeye, oversaw a competitive election as required by the Peace Accord, which was won by a different Hutu party, CND-FDD, completing the transition (Institute for Security Studies 2005)."
Cambodia (1953-70)	"Start: 11/9/1953 Independence under what was supposed to be a constitutional monarchy, but Sihanouk had suspended the constitution, dissolved the assembly, assumed the post of PM, and declared martial law before independence.

Cameroon (1960-83)	"Start: 1/1/1960 Independence under a system that was only formally democratic. One of the largest anti-colonial parties, the UPC, was outlawed both before and after independence, and repression was extensive. Ahidjo's strategy of cooptation of the remaining opposition parties changed gradually into forced merger and the arrest of peaceful opposition leaders by June 1962 (LeVine 1971, 103-5;Fearon and Laitin 2005)."	"End: 8/22/1983 A power struggle between former president Ahidjo, who remained leader of the sole party, and President Biya, who had succeeded Ahidjo as president the previous year, ended in Ahidjo's resignation and exile. Biya had been Ahidjo's PM and constitutional successor. He succeeded to the presidency when Ahidjo retired from the presidency in 1982. The coalition that supported Ahidjo and from which officials were drawn was multi-regional and multi-ethnic. Ahidjo was a northern Muslim and Biya a southern Christian. Soon after becoming president, Biya began replacing high officials chosen by Ahidjo with his own supporters. By late 1983, he had ousted the Muslim PM and head of the armed forces and begun narrowing the group with political influence and concentrating power in his own ethnic group. The post-1983 government is treated as a different regime because the regional and ethnic bases of policy influence changed (Wache 1991)."
Cameroon (1983-)	"Start: 8/22/1983 Ahidjo resigned as chair of the ruling party after losing a power struggle with Biya. The post-1983 period is coded as a different regime because of the change in the identity of the group that influenced policy and from which officials were chosen after Biya forced Ahidjo into exile. Under Ahidjo's leadership, the party was multi-ethnic, multi-regional, and included both Muslims and Christians. After Biya, who had been the southern Christian PM in the multiethnic coalition, succeeded Ahidjo, he forced Ahidjo's supporters from positions of importance and concentrated power within a small group of supporters from his own ethnic group (Wache 1991)."

Col and initiated a Revolutionary Governing Council chosen by the whole remaining officer corps (White 1973, 105; Baloyra 1982, 17; Stanley 1996, 67)."	"End: 3/28/1982 Constituent Assembly election. Under pressure from the U.S., a civilian, Maga~na,, was chosen provisional president by the Constituent Assembly. He assumed office on May 2, 1982 and the junta resigned (Sharpe and Diskin 1984, 533). In May 1984, a civilian president was elected in the second round of a fair presidential election. Candidates were chosen by political parties that were not under the full control of the military, the opposition won, and the civilian president was allowed to take office, though the military retained control over key policy decisions. This marks a transition from direct to indirect military rule; it is not considered a transition to democracy because popular parties on the left remained excluded from politics, and the military retained a veto over large areas of policy (Williams and Walter 1997, 114, 126-29)."
El Salvador (1982-94)	"Start: 3/28/1982 Transition from direct rule by a military junta to indirect military control of a civilian government. Under U.S. pressure, a Constituent Assembly from which the left had been excluded was elected, and it chose a civilian president acceptable to both the military and Washington. Though a presidential election was won by the permitted opposition in May 1984, the 1982-94 regime is coded as indirect military rule because continuing repression of the left prevented parties representing a substantial part of the population from participating in elections; in addition, experts judged that the military continued to dominate important aspects of policy choice, e.g., "Paradoxically, during the 1980s at the very time that a military-dominated junta was transferring formal power to a civilian president, the armed forces were successfully consolidating their presence in the state, expanding their network of control in the countryside, and maintaining their institutional autonomy" (Williams andWalter 1997, 114). Williams and Walter (1997, 127-28) describe a secret agreement between elected but not yet inaugurated President Duarte and General Vides Casanova to maintain the composition of the high command and cooperate with military policy preferences. The military "retained their right, and ability, to intervene in what they deemed undesirable situations" (Williams and Walter 1997, 129)"	"End: 3/20/1994 El Salvador's ruling group allowed a fair, fully competitive presidential election in which left parties ran for the first time (McBride 1994). This marks a transition to democracy."
Eritrea (1993-)	"Start: 5/24/1993 Independence under the control of Afwerki and the EPLF, one of the armed independence movements; they established a party-based government (Political Handbook of the World 2012g, 446)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Ethiopia (1889-1974)	"Start: 11/3/1889 The coronation of Menelik II after the seizure of the Ethipian throne in battle by Menelik of Shewa (then a vassal state of Ethiopia) initiated a new dynasty. Menelik unified the areas that currently form Ethiopia (Haile-Selassie 1997, 27-29, 34; Turner 1991; Mockler 2002, 89-90)."	"End: 9/12/1974 The emperor was deposed by the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army (the Dergue) (Abate 1983, 32). This marks the endpoint of a the transition from monarchy to rule by the Dergue, which had taken control of the government during a popular uprising that began February 1974 (Haile-Selassie 1997, 121, 127)."
Ethiopia (1974-91)	"Start: 9/12/1974 The Dergue (Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army) deposed the emperor, suspended parliament and the constitution after taking control of government during a popular uprising/military rebellion that began February 1974 (Abate 1983, 32; Keller 1991, 187; Haile-Selassie 1997, 121, 127). Between February and September 1974, the Dergue eliminated power holders of the old regime; the removal of the emperor completed the transition from monarchy to a new form of autocracy. When the crown prince, who had been offered the throne, refused to return to Ethiopia, the Dergue proclaimed itself acting head of state and changed its name to the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) on September 13, 1974 Haile-Selassie 1997, 128. The Dergue originally included three elected representatives from each unit of the armed forces; members ranged from ordinary soldiers to colonels (Erlich 1983, 473-75; Clapham 1985, 260; Haile-Selassie 1997, 147-48)."	"End: 5/8/1991 Mengistu fled the country after the regime was defeated by insurgents from several different regions. Remaining officials declared a ceasefire and EPRDF forces began entering Addis Ababa on May 27, 1991 (Haile-Selassie 1997, 284-328)."
Ethiopia (1991-)	"Start: 5/27/1991 EPRDF forces began entering Addis Ababa after defeating the Ethiopian army along with insurgents from several different regions and set up a government (Haile-Selassie 1997, 284-328)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Gabon (1960-)	"Start: 8/17/1960 Independence with M'ba already in office as Prime Minister, supported by the French. Although the political system was formally parliamentary with an elected assembly, before independence M'ba had already arrested an opposition leader and intimidated some opposition deputies into switching parties. Gerrymandering and a multimember district, plurality electoral system gave the BDG a very strong majority in the June 1960 election. In November 1960 he interned 8 opponents in his own party (Bernault 1996, 294-97)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Gambia (1965-94)	"Start: 2/18/1965 Independence under single-party government led by Jawara and the PPP. The PPP won the pre-independence election in 1962. Members of other parties were coopted into the ruling party. The only important opposition party won a third of the seats in 1962, but by 10/64, seven of its 13 MPs had crossed the aisle. It won seven seats in the 1966 election, and neither it nor other opposition parties won more than seven altogether in subsequent elections. The Jawara government did not use repression against its challengers, but it did very successfully use state resources to maintain its dominant position. Although opposition parties were always allowed to run in elections, this regime is included in the data set because the ruling PPP maintained an uneven playing field through monopolization of patronage and state resources for nearly 30 years (Hughes and Perfect 2008, l-lvii; Political Handbook of the World 2012h, 509)."	"End: 7/22/1994 Coup led by junior officers ( Economist 1996c; Saine 1996, 97)."
Gambia (1994-)	"Start: 7/22/1994 Coup led by Lt Jammeh and other junior officers created the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council to rule (Economist 1996c, 44, Saine 1996, 97)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Georgia (1991-92)	"Start: 9/16/1991 The arrest of the most important opposition leaders and repression of demonstrators in September 1991 identifies the date when the Gamsakhurdia government crossed the line from more-or-less democratic to autocratic (Los Angeles Times 1991; Global Security 2011e)."	"End: 1/6/1992 Violent overthrow of the civilian government by a faction of the militia forces that had been incorporated into the national army (Zurcher 2007, 126-27; Global Security 2011e)."
Georgia (1992-2003)	"Start: 1/6/1992 Violent ouster of the Gamsakhurdia government by a faction of the militia forces that had been incorporated into the new national army; the coup leaders invited Shevardnadze to return to the country and lead the government (Slider 1994; Zurcher 2007, 126-27; Global Security 2011e)."	"End: 11/23/2003 Demonstrations led to Shevardnadze's resignation and the transfer of power to an opposition interim president who held fair presidential elections in January 2004, won by a leader of what had been the opposition to Shevardnadze (Jones 2009, 317-34; U.S. Dept. of State 2009; Devdariani 2011, 107-108)."
Germany, East (1949-1990)	"Start: 10/7/1949 This date marks the establishment of a separate East German state and the Soviet transfer of power to the newly chosen governing institutions of the German Democratic Republic (Gallagher 1987)"	"End: 3/18/1990 Socialist Unity Party (communist) lost a competitive election which was forced on the government by massive demonstrations (Pfaff 2006, 242)."
Ghana (1960-66)	"Start: 4/27/1960 "Authoritarianization" due to de facto one-party rule and increasing concentration of power in Nkrumah's hands, preventive detention law used to control opposition. Post-independence authoritarianzation was gradual; on this date a referendum confirmed Nkrumah as president and concentrated power in the presidency; it is identified as the point at which the threshold between democracy and autocracy was crossed (Pinkney 1972, 15-16; Finer 1975, 501; McLaughlin and Owusu-Ansah 1994; Brooker 1995, 103-10; African Elections Database 2011a)."	"End: 2/24/1966 Coup led by Col. Kotoka with support from the senior commander of the police ousted the civilian government (Pinkney 1972, 70; Bebler 1973, 36-38; Brooker 1995, 111-12)."
Ghana (1966-69)	"Start: 2/24/1966 Coup led by Col Kotoka and Maj Afrifa, handed power to dismissed Maj Gen Ankrah and established the ruling group, National Liberation Council, of 4 military and 4 police officers (Pinkney 1972, 2, 121; Bebler 1973, 36-40)."	"End: 8/29/1969 Competitive election after the military agreed to return to the barracks (Bebler 1973, 54-55; Dowse 1975, 24; African Elections Database 2011a)."
Ghana (1972-79)	"Start: 1/13/1972 coup led by Lt Col Acheampong ousted the elected government and established the Military Redemption Council, initially 6 colonels and majors with 1 civilian, but expanded to 12 to include all services and "satisfy hierarchical propriety"; the civilian was dropped. In 1975 the MRC was replaced by a seven man Supreme Military Council composed of the heads of the services, police, border guards, and chief of the defense staff (Bebler 1973, 56-60; Bennett 1975, 308; Political Handbook of the World 2012i, 539)."	"End: 7/9/1979 Second round of competitive presidential elections agreed to by the military as a means of democratizing (African Elections Database 2011a)."
Ghana (1981-2000)	"Start: 12/31/1981 Coup led by Flight Lt Rawlings, established the Provisional National Defense Council, a mixed military and civilian ruling group (McLaughlin and Owusu-Ansah 1994)."	"End: 12/28/2000 The ruling NDC lost the second round of a competitive presidential election (African Elections Database 2011a)."
Greece (1967-74)	"Start: 4/21/1967 Coup led by Col Papadopoulos and the Holy Bond of Greek Offi- cers (IDEA) military faction installed themselves as rulers (Feit 1973, 118-22; Brown 1974, 217; Veremis 1985, 30-32)."	"End: 7/23/1974 Military transfer of power to Karamanlis in preparation for competitive elections and transition to democracy (Veremis 1985, 41)."
Guatemala (1954-58)	"Start: 6/27/1954 A CIA-sponsored invasion by exiles supported by part of the military ousted the elected government (Gibson 1989, 172; Dunkerley 1992, 300)."	"End: 2/2/1958 Congress chose the plurality winner of the January 1958 election as president. Although several parties that would have been expected to attract substantial votes were excluded from participation, and thus the election is not considered democratic, it was nevertheless won by a candidate opposed by the military. The election did lead to a transition to rule by a civilian not selected by the military and thus is coded as the end of the preceding military regime (New York Times 1958; Dunkerley 1988, 439)."
Guatemala (1958-63)	"Start: 2/2/1958 Congress chose the next president after a competitive election in which the left was not permitted to run led to the election of a right-wing populist candidate opposed by the military. This regime is considered authoritarian because the military prohibited left and center-left parties supported by a large segment of the population from competing in the election (Dunkerley 1988, 439)."	"End: 3/30/1963 Coup led by Col. Peralta, Defense Minister (Dunkerley 1988, 443)."
Guatemala (1963-66)	"Start: 3/30/1963 Coup led by Col Peralta, Def Min established a military ruling group (Dunkerley 1988, 443)."	"End: 5/10/1966 Congress selected the president after the March 1966 presidential election, as required by the constitution, because the election failed to produce a majority winner. The left and several other parties were not allowed to run, but nevertheless a civilian centrist candidate, Mendez Montenegro, won a plurality of the votes in opposition to a military sponsored candidate (Weaver 1970, 68, 77-78; Calvert 1985, 83). The transition to a civilian president is coded as a regime change because the military lost direct control of the presidency, even though it maintained control over substantial areas of policy."
Guatemala (1966-70)	"Start: 5/10/1966 Congressional selection of Mendez Montenegro, the plurality winner of the March 1966 election, in which the left and several other parties were prohibited from running. The regime is considered authoritarian because the election was semicompetitive and Mendez had to agree to military control of its "own" affairs and important policy areas in order to be inaugurated - not just control of the war against the insurgency, but also tax and other important domestic policies (Weaver 1970, 68, 78; Johnson 1971, 35; Calvert 1985, 83; Dunkerley 1988, 459). Therefore the regime is coded as indirect military rule. Beginning in November 1966 a state of siege further curtailed constitutional rights (Dunkerley 1988, 457)."	"End: 3/1/1970 Election of Col. Arana, nominated by the military, marks the end of indirect military rule and the beginning of direct military rule (Johnson 1971, 41; Dunkerley 1988, 459). This is considered a regime change because the group from which the leader could be selected narrowed to top military officers."
Guatemala (1970-85)	"Start: 3/1/1970 Election of Col Arana, candidate of the military, MLN and PID, in an election in which the left and some other parties were prohibited from running (Johnson 1971, 41; Berger 1986, 563; Dunkerley 1988, 459; Montenegro Rios 2002, 122-23, 133). From this election until 1985, only military officers were permitted to win elections, so this regime is coded as a different from the previous one in which civilians shared top policy making positions with the military."	"End: 12/8/85 Second round of semi-competitive presidential elections in which the military did not run or back a candidate, won by the Christian Democrats (Nohlen 2005, 323). This is considered a regime end because the group from which leaders could be chosen expanded to include civilians, and civilians controlled many aspects of policy even though the military maintained veto power over substantial aspects of policy and prevented the left from competing in elections (Weaver 1994, 238; Dunkerley and Sieder 1996, 83; Leonard 1998, 106; Jonas 2000, 26)."
Guatemala (1985-95)	"Start: 12/8/1985 The second round of a fair, semi-competitive presidential election in which non-leftist parties were allowed to run was won by the Christian Democrats (Anderson 1988, 61). The military retained control of its own affairs and veto power over substantial areas of policy (Dunkerley 1988, 498-99). Regime is considered authoritarian despite competitive elections because the military continued to exclude parties on the left from electoral competition and to exercise veto power in some policy areas."	"End: 11/12/1995 Fair and competitive general elections in which the left was for the first time allowed to participate marks the end of indirect military rule and a transition to democracy (Jonas 2000, 21-22). Over time between 1985 and 1995, the military reduced its areas of policy control. The 1995 change in the identity of the group from which leaders could be drawn and in the rules for selecting leaders completes the transition to democracy (Center for Democratic Performance 2011)."
Guinea (1958-84)	"Start: 10/2/1958 Independence under PDG single-party rule. The PDG won a fair election before independence, but the opposition merged with the PDG soon after independence. The regime is considered authoritarian because the government began suppressing opposition soon after independence (Finer 1975, 495-96; Brooker 1995, 117-18; U.S. Dept. of State 2011b)."	"End: 4/3/1984 Coup led by Lt Col Conte and other middle ranking officers against the PDG regime after Toure's death (Economist Intelligence Unit 2008d; U.S. Dept. of State 2011a; Political Handbook of the World 2012j)."
Guinea (1984-2008)	"Start: 4/3/1984 Coup led by Lt Col Conte established the Comite Militaire de Redressement National to rule (U.S. Dept. of State 2011a; Political Handbook of the World 2012j, 569)."	"End: 12/23/2008 Coup led by Capt. Camara against those attempting to perpetuate the Conte regime after his death (Economist 2009; U.S. Dept. of State 2011a; Political Handbook of the World 2012j)."
Guinea (2008-10)	"Start: 12/23/2008 Coup led by Capt Camara, established the Comite National pour le De velopement et la De mocratie (National Council for Democracy and Development) to rule (U.S. Dept. of State 2011a, Political Handbook of the World 2012j, 570)."	"End: 1/16/2010 Agreement between Konate, Camara, and the opposition turned power over to a transitional government led by the opposition until elections (All Africa 2010). President Camara was shot in December 2009 and General Konate took over as president while Camara was in Morocco for medical treatment. Second round of competitive presidential election on November 7 2010 completed transition to democracy (Burgis 2010, 1; Political Handbook of the World 2012j)."
Guinea Bissau (1974-80)	"Start: 9/10/1974 Independence under the single party that had led the fight for independence, PAIGC, led by Luis Cabral (Piette 2005, 526)."	"End: 11/14/1980 Coup led by ex-Brig Gen Vieira ousted the civilian regime. The subsequent regime is coded as different because its ethnic base was different, despite the maintenance of the same ruling party (U.S. Dept. of State 2011c; Political Handbook of the World 2012k, 578)."
Guinea Bissau (1980-99)	"Start: 11/14/1980 Coup led by PM and ex-Brig Gen Vieira, recently replaced by Cabral as commander of the army. This regime is considered different from the previous one because Cabral and his closest supporters came from Cape Verde, but Vieira and his were from mainland Guinea Bissau. PAIGC led both countries until 1980, and unification was in the works. Vieira maintained the single party but replaced the National Assembly and State Council with a predominantly military nine-man Revolutionary Council. Cape Verde ended plans for unification after the coup, and most Cape Verdians left the party (Forrest 1987, 103-5; Piette 2005, 526; Political Handbook of the World 2012k, 579)."	"End: 5/7/1999 Vieira ousted by an insurgency led by ex-army chief of staff Brig Gen Mane (BBC News 1999a; Piette 2005, 529; Political Handbook of the World 2012k)."
Guinea Bissau (2002-03)	"Start: 11/16/2002 The elected president, Yala, dissolved parliament, and then repeatedly postponed new elections. We code parliament's dissolution as the point at which Yala crossed the line from democracy to autocracy. He also refused to promulgate the 2001 constitution and governed by decree, harassed the opposition and arrested opposition leaders (Piette 2005, 532-33; Freedom House 2010; Political Handbook of the World 2012k, 579)."	"End: 9/14/2003 Coup led by Chief of Staff and Defense Min Correia Seabra ousted Yala and established a transitional government that oversaw a transition to democracy (United Nations Information Service 2003; Political Handbook of the World 2012k, 579). Fair legislative elections were held in March 2004, and fair presidential elections in June-July 2005 completed the transition the following year (African Elections Database 2011b)."
Haiti (1941-46)	"Start: 6/5/1941 After the president was elected by the elected Assembly, repression of opponents began immediately. We identify the date when the president took personal control of the Garde d'Haiti (the National Guard, Haiti's military), which was used against the opposition, as the point when the line between democracy and autocracy was crossed (Smith 2009, 43; Hatian Media 2012)."	"End: 1/11/1946 Violent popular uprising led to Lescot's resignation. Interim military government oversaw competitive elections May 1946 (Nohlen 1993, 389; Smith 2009, 80-81, 89; Hatian Media 2012). Although suffrage was not universal, it was broad enough to meet the coding criteria for democracy (Nohlen 1993, 379)."
Haiti (1950-56)	"Start: 5/10/1950 Coup led by the three commanding officers in the context of violent pro- and anti-government demonstrations and the elected president's effort to extend his term illegally (Nohlen 1993, 389; Smith 2009, 144-47)."	"End: 12/12/1956 Popular protests forced President Magloire to resign. He was succeeded by the head of the Supreme Court who agreed to fair competitive elections (Smith 2009, 171-72; Hall 2012, 272)."
Haiti (1957-86)	"Start: 6/14/1957 Coup ousted the interim government (the third since December 1956) and announced a new election date for September 1957. The military government then supervised an unfair election in which their favored candidate, F. Duvalier, was elected (Nohlen 1993, 389; Smith 2009, 177-83)."	"End: 2/7/1986 Jean-Claude Duvalier fled because of popular uprising and was replaced by an interim government under Lt. Gen. Namphy, Chief of Staff (Nicholls 1998, 165-66; U.S. Dept. of State 2010a."
Haiti (1986-88)	"Start: 2/7/1986 The formation of what was supposed to be an interim transitional government made up of two civilians and three officers, the Conseil National de Gouvernement, led by Lt-Gen Namphy. This government is not treated as a continuation of the previous regime because it authorized legal proceedings against Duvalier allies and banned them from holding office for ten years (Payne and Sutton 1993, 80-84), thus changing the rules for choosing leaders. The first attempted election in November 1987 was canceled because of violence. The opposition boycotted the new election in January 1988, which was rigged to produce a winner acceptable to the military. In June 1988 Namphy ousted the newly elected civilian president who was expected to cooperate with the military but had tried to dismiss him (Payne and Sutton 1993, 89; Nicholls 1998, 169)."	"End: 9/17/1988 Coup by junior officers and non-commissioned officers ousted the government led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and high ranking officers (Payne and Sutton 1993, 90)."
Haiti (1988-90)	"Start: 9/17/1988 Coup led by non-commissioned officers established a new ruling group (Nohlen 1993, 390; Payne and Sutton 1993, 90)."	"End: 3/10/1990 The military handed power to an interim government headed by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, to oversee a democratic transition (Nohlen 1993, 390; Payne and Sutton 1993, 92-94; Hall 2012, 272)."
Haiti (1991-94)	"Start: 9/30/1991 coup led by Brig Gen Cedras ousted the elected president and established military rule (Nohlen 1993, 390; U.S. Dept. of State 2010a)."	"End: 10/12/1994 Military regime led by Cedras ousted by foreign intervention, which oversaw the return of the previously elected president (Malone 2008, 133; Global Security 2011d; Hall 2012, 272)."
Haiti (1999-2004)	"Start: 1/12/1999 "Authoritarianization" when elected President Preval suspended the legislature and began to rule by decree after the legislature refused to confirm his third nominee for PM, amid accusations of vote rigging in legislative elections (Erickson 2004; Wucker 2004, 45)."	"End: 2/29/2004 Aristide fled in response to a popular uprising led by a former police chief and criminal gang leaders (Erickson 2005, 86; Hall 2012, 272)."
Honduras (1933-56)	"Start: 11/26/1933 Gen Carias won a fair election in October 1932, but maintained the state of siege declared by his predecessor and extended his political control to all areas of the country through the appointment of local political and military offi- cials. Initially, Carias relied primarily on patronage and control over the distribution of state resources to coopt opposition politicians. We date "authoritarianization" to the manipulated municipal elections of November 1933. Beginning in 1935, arrests and repression of the opposition became more extensive (Stokes 1950, 219-26; Mac- Cameron 1983, 17; Haggerty and Millet 1993; Leonard 1998, 96; Dodd 2005, 62-71)."	"End: 10/21/1956 Coup that installed an interim government to oversee a democratic transition (Anderson 1981, 59-60; Morris 1984, 11-12, 36-38)."
Honduras (1963-71)	"Start: 10/3/1963 Coup led by Air Force Col and commander of the armed forces Lopez Arellano ousted the elected government and established a military junta (Haggerty and Millet 1993, Morris 1984, 39)."	"End: 3/28/1971 Fair election under the auspices of a pact for power sharing between the PN and PL that led to a transition to civilian rule (Morris 1984, 43; Anderson 1988, 134)."
Honduras (1972-81)	"Start: 12/4/1972 Coup led by Gen Lopez Arellano (promoted while previously in power) ousted the elected president and reestablished military rule (Morris 1984, 44)."	"End: 11/29/1981 Competitive election ended military rule (Pearson 1982, 439; An68 Autocratic regime Start and End events derson 1988, 155). The election was won by the party not supported by the military, and the elected president took office in January 1982, completing the transition to democracy."
Hungary (1947-90)	"Start: 2/25/1947 The arrest of the Smallholders' secretary general and a number of other opposition activists on trumped up charges marks the point at which the communists' gradual takeover crossed the line to autocratic regime. Although the communists did not control the government between the fair 1945 election and the unfair election in August 1947, they controlled the Interior Ministry and the police as part of a Smallholder-led coalition, which allowed them to intimidate and arrest supporters of other parties. They intimidated the Smallholders' PM into resigning in May 1947. Despite intimidation and fraud, the communists won only a plurality (22%) of the vote in 1947, but were able to control the succeeding government through a coalition with allies in other parties. The disorganization and repression of the Smallholders' Party, which had been the largest, was completed in 1947, and the Social Democrats, the other authentic large party, were forced to merge with the communists in June 1948 (Rakosi 1952; Sudetic 1993; Nyyssonen 2001, 892; Wittenberg 2006, 56-57; Institute for the History of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution 2012)."	"End: 4/8/1990 Second round of fair and competitive parliamentary elections (March 25 and April 8) won by an opposition party (Racz 1991, 112; U.S. Dept. of State 2011d). Although the communist party legalized other parties, gave up its constitutional role in leading the country, and carried out several other important reforms during 1989, it did not actually lose control of the government until the 1990 elections."
Indonesia (1949-66)	"Start: 12/27/1949 Independence under Sukarno's leadership. At independence, Sukarno was unelected president. The unelected first parliament included representatives of the Dutch-created states, members of the revolutionary committee, and members appointed by Sukarno based on estimates of the various parties' strength. The first parliamentary election was not held until September 1955 (Liddle 1978, 173-74)."	"End: 3/11/66 "Soft" coup forced Sukarno to yield executive power to Suharto and changed the identity of the group that could influence policy and from which leaders could be chosen. Many groups of civilians were eliminated from the ruling group, which army officers dominated after 3/66. The counterattack and mass killing led by Suharto after the attempted leftist military rebellion of October 1, 1965 is not treated as the transition event because Sukarno remained in office with the balance of power between him and Suharto uncertain. The PKI (communist party) was destroyed as an important base of civilian support for Sukarno, but he maintained the support of the two largest parties, PNI and NU, most leading officers in the air force, navy, and police, and important officers in the army until March 1966. Sukarno refused to outlaw the PKI despite military pressure, and he was able to appoint ministers and top military officers opposed by the army high command during that time (Crouch 1988, 158-78). Consequently, we code Sukarno as still in control until March 1966. The military-instigated pogrom against communists and others was largely over before the coup that changed the leadership at the top (Crouch 1988, 135-63). The March 1966 coup resulted in the transfer of day-to-day executive power to Suharto, the arrest of more than fifteen ministers, the purge of left-leaning bureaucrats, officers, and PNI party leaders, and the symbolically important outlawing of the PKI. Thus we code it as the point at which Sukarno lost control, though he retained the formal title president until March 1967 (Crouch 1988, 188-202)."
Indonesia (1966-99)	"Start: 3/11/1966 Transfer of the most important political and military powers to Suharto (Crouch 1988, 188-202)."	"End: 6/7/1999 Fair and competitive parliamentary election won by the opposition. In October 1999, the mostly elected legislature chose a new president from the opposition (Thompson 1999, 1). Suharto's resignation in response to mass demonstrations is not treated as the regime end because he transferred power to his long-time close ally Habibie, and there were no major changes in either the cabinet or the military command under Habibie (Kingsbury 2003, 162)."
Iran (1925-79)	"Start: 12/15/1925 This is the date the Majlis crowned Reza Khan as Reza Shah, beginning of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Khan, commander of the only Persian officered armed force of the Qajar dynasty, seized Teheran by armed force in February 1921. A civilian ally was appointed PM and in turn appointed Reza Khan commander of the armed forces. Reza Khan became PM in 1923 when the shah went into exile. The Majlis deposed the Qajar dynasty in October 1925 and handed the crown to Reza Khan in December 1925 (Bakhash 1987; Kechichian 1987)."	"End: 1/16/1979 Departure of the Shah in response to massive demonstrations (Bakhash 1989; BBC News 2008a)."
Iran (1979-)	"Start: 1/16/1979 Ouster of the Shah by popular uprising led to the establishment of a new ruling group led by Ayatolla Khomeini (Bakhash 1987; BBC News 2008a)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Iraq (1932-58)	"Start: 10/13/1932 Independence under a monarchy established by the British; they gave the crown to King Faisal, who had been ousted from Syria by the French, as a reward for his military support against Turkey. He was a Sunni with no previous ties to Iraq (Haddad 1971, 55-57, Lewis 1988)."	"End: 7/14/1958 Coup murdered the royal family and ended the monarchy (Dann 1969, 19-33; Haddad 1971, 86, 91-92; Dawisha 2009, 172)."
Iraq (1958-63)	"Start: 7/14/1958 Coup led by Brig-Gen Qassem (or Kassem or Qasim) established military rule (Dann 1969, 19-33, Dawisha 2009, 172)."	"End: 2/8/1963 Coup led by lower ranking officers (Haddad 1971, 122-24; Be'eri 1982, 80). The post-1963 period is treated as a new regime because lower ranking officers supported initially by the Ba'ath party replaced higher ranking officers who had ruled from 1958-63, supported by the Communists (Haddad 1971, 115-16, 122-29)."
Iraq (1963-68)	"Start: 2/8/1963 Coup by a faction of middle ranking Ba'thist officers, Nasserist offi- cers, and the Ba'thist paramilitary National Guard established the National Council of Revolutionary Command to rule. Ba'thists were ousted from the ruling group in early 1964 (Haddad 1971, 115-16, 122-29, Lewis 1988)."	"End: 7/17/1968 Coup replaced the previous government, which had excluded the Ba'th after a short time, with a government dominated by the Ba'th faction of the military, many of whom had been forced into retirement by the Aref government. The post-1968 regime is considered different from the 1963-68 regime because the first excluded Ba'thists and the second excluded non-Ba'thists (Haddad 1971, 138- 40, 143-44, 157-64)."
Iraq (1968-79)	"Start: 7/17/1968 Coup led by ex-Maj Gen al-Bakr installed a regime dominated by Ba'thist military officers and ruled through the Revolutionary Command Council of the Ba'thist party's military section (Haddad 1971, 138-40, 143-44, 157-64; Farouk- Sluglett and Sluglett 1987, 115-17, 120; Brooker 1997, 115). The post-1968 regime is considered different from the previous one because the group from which top leaders could be chosen and who could influence policy was limited to Ba'thists, who had been excluded from the earlier regime not long after the seizure of power."	"End: 7/16/1979 Formal transfer of power from Field Marshal al-Bakr to Saddam Hussein marks the end of a gradual shift from a regime based mostly on Ba'thist military officers and the Ba'th party to one in which the group from which leaders could be chosen included few outside Hussein's family and home region. The post- 1979 government is considered a new regime because under al-Bakr, Ba'thist officers dominated policy choice but were marginalized under Hussein (Brooker 1997, 115-16)."
Iraq (1979-2003)	"Start: 7/16/1979 The formal transfer of power from Field Marshal al-Bakr to Saddam Hussein completed a gradual shift from a regime based mostly on Ba'thist military officers and the Ba'th party to one in which the group from which leaders could be chosen included few outside Saddam's family and home region. Saddam had built his power base in the party and security service, not the officer corps. He exerted significant party control within the military through his control of party networks prior to al-Bakr's retirement, but he was not a career officer. After al-Bakr's retirement, Saddam purged the party of anyone with an independent base of support and then reduced the party's power and relevance. He executed several members of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council a few days after his accession to full power. Beginning in 1980, the party was subordinated to the military and security services. The party's Regional Command was stacked with Saddam's ministerial and security service subordinates, his advisors, and his relatives (Farouk-Sluglett and Sluglett 1987, 208-13; Brooker 1997, 115-18; Kamrava 1998, 73)."	"End: 4/7/2003 The fall of Baghdad to invading U.S. and coalition forces (Economist Intelligence Unit 2008e). U.S. forces took control of presidential palace on April 7 (Guardian 2003). [The period from April 2003 to March 2010 is excluded from the data set because foreign occupied. The election of March 2010 is not considered free and fair because, among other things, nearly 500 candidates were prevented from running. March 7, 2010 thus marks a transition to autocracy, but is not included in the data set because its first year would be 2011.]"
Ivory Coast (1960-99)	"Start: 8/7/1960 Independence with Houphouet-Boigny as PM and the government controlled by the PDCI. The PDCI won all pre-independence elections to various offices. It ran unopposed in the 4/59 Assembly elections, giving it control of the government and electoral rules at independence (Zolberg 1964, 75-271, African Elections Database n.d.a). The party was genuinely popular and it had limited competition mainly via cooptation of rivals, but in 1959 began manipulating electoral rules to limit the ability of potential opposition groups to compete (Zolberg 1964, 188, 264- 65)."	"End: 12/24/1999 Coup by officers and NCOs, turned power over to a junta led by ex-army Chief of Staff Gen. Guei (Cornewell 2000)."
Ivory Coast (1999-2000)	"Start: 12/24/1999 Coup/mutiny by junior officers and NCOs, turned power over to a junta led by ex-army chief-of-staff Gen Guei .

Ivory Coast (2000-)	"Start: 10/26/2000 popular uprising by Gbagbo supporters, including much of the military and security forces, in response to Guei's effort to steal an election, installed Gbagbo in power (Englebert 2004b, 332)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010. [Ousted April 11, 2011]"
Jordan (1946-)	"Start: 5/25/1946 Independence under a monarchy established by the British. King Adbullah of the Hashemite family was the son of the Ottoman amir of Mecca, who claimed a hereditary right to rule in the Hijaz. He was a leader of the Arab nationalist movement against Ottoman rule and sided with the British during World Wars I and II (Lewis 1989)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Kazakhstan (1991-)	"Start: 12/16/1991 Independence with Nazarbaev already president and a legislature dominated by ex-communists. Nazarbaev maintained much of the structure and personnel of the communist system (Kadyrzhanov 1999, 147; Olcott 2010, 92-93)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Kenya (1963-2002)	"Start: 12/12/1963 Independence with KANU and Kenyatta in power. KANU won the May 1963 competitive pre-independence election and then coopted the leaders of the main opposition party, which dissolved itself. Defacto single-party rule was maintained mainly through the president's control over resources and patronage. When Odinga, who had led the opposition and initially agreed to the merger, resigned from KANU and attempted to form a new opposition party, the government used various manipulations and intimidation to undermine it before it was banned in 1969 (Decalo 1998, 194-95, 218-27)."

Korea, South (1948-60)	"Start: 8/13/1948 Independence under a government led by Rhee. His supporters had won the 5/48 legislative elections, which were boycotted by some important political groupings. U.S. occupation policy had eliminated most of what had been a strong left from the playing field, so the 1948 election is not coded as fully competitive (Cumings 1993)"	"End: 4/27/1960 Demonstrations led to Rhee's ouster and a transition to democracy (Kim 1968, 302-03)."
Korea, South (1961-87)	"Start: 5/16/1961 Coup by young officers led by Maj Gen Park ousted the elected government and established rule by a junta called the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction (Kim 1968, 298, 303).

Kyrgyzstan (1991-2005)	"Start: 8/31/1991 Independence, Akayev and the communist-dominated Supreme Soviet in control. The communist party was formally dissolved, but Akayev's networks remained powerful. Akayev was elected president unopposed shortly after independence (U.S. Dept. of State 2011e)."	"End: 3/24/2005 Massive demonstrations caused Akayev's resignation and  ight, leading to an interim government controlled by the opposition and new elections (Radnitz 2006, 132; Hiro 2009, 305-07; U.S. Dept. of State 2011e)."
Kyrgyzstan (2005-10)	"Start: 7/10/2005 Rigged election is identified as the date on which the "authoritarianization" of the transitional government became unambiguous. Bakiyev was a leader of the opposition to Akayev and was chosen as interim president and PM after Akayev was ousted. His government was supposed to oversee a democratic election, but instead he was able to gain control of the electoral machinery and rig his own election (U.S. Dept. of State 2011e)."

Laos (1960-62)	"Start: 12/16/1960 Gen Phoumi's troops retook Vientiane from the neutralist government and the military faction defending it (Stuart-Fox 1986, 27; Dommen 1994; Chaloemtiarana 2007a, 162). After the December 1960 coup, Laos had two governments, one controlled by the right and the other controlled by Souvanna Phouma and Capt. Kong Le, who espoused neutral policies. The neutralist government was established in the Plain of Jars (Stuart-Fox 1986, 27). The government led by Gen Phoumi and his civilian PM seems to have been the stronger and controlled the capital, so it is the one we code."	"End: 7/24/1962 Tripartite coalition was forced on Gen. Phoumi and his supporters by the U.S. (Stuart-Fox 1986, 27-28; Dommen 1994). The Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos establishing the Tripartite government signed on July 24, 1962 (Lee 1969, 536). [Laos 1963-75 is excluded from the data set because both sides in the civil war were controlled by foreigners, and the royal Lao government lost control of much of the territory.

Laos (1975-)	"Start: 11/29/1975 The abdication by the king and resignation of the PM were the final steps in the mostly peaceful transition from coalition to communist government between May and December 1975. In May 1975 large, communist-organized student and union demonstrations against the anti-communists in the coalition government caused several non-communist ministers and a number of top generals to resign and flee the country. Continuing demonstrations in May and June caused the US to withdraw from Laos. Between July and November, most remaining high level officers and civil servants were sent, most voluntarily, for what was supposed to be a few months of political re-education. In November communist-led demonstrations demanded the resignation of the neutralist government and the end of the monarchy, and on November 29, 1975 neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma resigned and the king abdicated. On December 1-2 1975, the National Congress of People's Representatives abolished the monarchy and formed the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Stuart-Fox 1986, 33- 35)."

Liberia (1944-80)	"Start: 1/1/1944 This date is considered the regime start because the formal and informal rules governing Liberian politics changed after Tubman's inauguration as president. Prior to Tubman, citizenship and political participation were limited to Americo-Liberians, descendants of U.S. slaves who had colonized the coast of Liberia in the 19th century. Tubman granted citizenship to all Liberians and incrementally extended political participation to indigenous Liberians. In May 1945 new suffrage laws extended the vote to all male and female citizens who owned property and paid the hut tax (African Elections Database 2011e). Tubman changed the formal rules about who could influence policy by extending suffrage, but also changed the informal rules of political decision making, reducing the influence of traditional True Whig Party institutions and procedures and personalizing decision making within his own family and patronage network, which extended into the indigenous hinterland (Lowenkopf 1972, 94-108). Rule, which had been based on Americo-Liberian family alliances, "has been greatly modified by the personal nature of Tubman's rule," made possible by a large increase in foreign investment and hence government revenues at the president's disposal (Lowenkopf 1972, 99-100)."

Madagascar (1960-72)	"Start: 6/26/1960 Independence under the leadership of Tsiranana and the PSD. According to Covell (1987, 30), French colonial administrators chose moderate, pro- French Tsiranana as party founder and first national leader. He was indirectly elected president before independence in 1959. The PSD general secretary became the Minister of the Interior and controlled "the organization (and results) of elections" (Covell 1987, 32). The "political system strongly favored the incumbent" (Schraeder 1994). For these reasons, we code the regime as authoritarian."	"End: 5/18/1972 Tsiranana handed power to the military in the face of widespread demonstrations and strikes (Covell, 1987, 47-48; Marcus 2004, 1)."
Madagascar (1972-75)	"Start: 5/18/1972 Tsiranana handed power to the military in the face of widespread demonstrations and strikes.

Ratsiraka initiated a transition from collective leadership by top ranked military officers to a ruling coalition that included civilians organized in a new party as well as officers (Covell 1987, 57-62). The post- 1975 period is treated as a new regime because the group from which officials could be chosen and who could influence policy changed from top military officers to a coalition of officers and civilian party leaders."

He established the ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council. Ratsiraka initiated a transition from collective leadership by top ranked military officers to a ruling coalition that included civilians organized in a new party as well as officers (Covell 1987, 52-62, 103-4). The post-1975 period is treated as a new regime because the group from which officials could be chosen and who could influence policy changed from top military officers to a coalition of officers and civilian party leaders.

Madagascar (2009-)	"Start: 3/17/2009 The elected president handed power to the military, which in turn handed it to the civilian leader of the opposition, in response to violent protests and a military mutiny (BBC News 2009; U.S. Dept. of State 2011g; Political Handbook of the World 2012m)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Malawi (1964-94)	"Start: 7/6/1964 Independence under the control of Banda and the MCP. The MCP won a sweeping victory in the August 1961 election for African seats in the Nyasaland legislature while what would later become Malawi was still part of the federation that included Rhodesia. Banda became PM of Nyasaland in February 1963 when it was granted internal self-government. The MCP had already consolidated one-party rule before independence, and Banda had established his personal control of the party as well. Opposition groups were intimidated from nominating candidates in the 1964 elections before independence. Shortly after independence a substantial faction of the party, including several members of Banda's first cabinet, were dismissed or purged after proposing limits on Banda's personal power, and others resigned and soon  ed the country (Decalo 1998, 58-68, U.S. Dept. of State 2011h)."

Malaysia (1957-)	"Start: 8/31/1957 Independence. The British left power in the hands of Tunku Abdul Rahman, the leader of UMNO, a Malay ethnic party, allied with Chinese and Indian ethnic parties in the Alliance. In 1955, the Alliance had won 51 of 52 contested seats in a 98 seat legislative council in which the British controlled the other seats. At that time, it was difficult for non-Malays to become citizens, and 84% of the electorate was Malay though only 50% of inhabitants were. Thus the elected legislative council was not democratic, as defined in the coding rules, because it was less than 60% elected, and suffrage was limited by ethnic restrictions (Rabushka 1970, 346-47; Andaya and Andaya 1982; Means 1996, 103)."

Mali (1960-68)	"Start: 9/22/1960 Independence under the control of Keita and US-RDA, which won the first universal suffrage election in 1957 and "had already swept away or absorbed all semblance of opposition" before independence (Vengroff and Kone 1995, 46). The country was declared a one-party state shortly after independence (Englebert 2004c, 635)."	"End: 11/19/1968 Coup led by a captain and lieutenant ousted the Keita government (Bebler 1973, 87-88)."

"End: 3/26/1991 Officers arrested Traore in response to popular rioting and formed a mostly civilian transitional government within a few days.

The government was led by the MPP, which developed from nationalist to communist during the 1920s under Soviet influence. Initially the MPP shared authority with the Bogdo Khan (traditional holy ruler combining leadership of government and religion), but those who supported a more traditional form of rule were eliminated and often executed after a series of factional conflicts within the party during the 1920s (Bawden 1968, 230-37; Worden 1989)."	"End: 6/6/1993 Competitive election of an opposition candidate in the first direct election of a president.We count this election as the regime end even though Ochirbat was the winning opposition candidate because he ran against a candidate of the ruling MPRP, and the June 1993 election marks the end of communist monopolization of the Mongolian political system (Ginsburg 1995, 462-71).

Namibia (1990-)	"Start: 3/21/1990 Independence under the control of SWAPO, which led the armed fight for independence and won the UN-monitored Constituent Assembly election before independence, led by its president, Nujoma. SWAPO has won all subsequent elections and maintained more than two thirds of the seats in the legislature since the first post-independence election in 1994 (African Elections Database 2011h). Although elections have generally been considered fair, the ruling party has monopolized the use of state resources to influence outcomes, harassed the media, and controlled the electoral tribunal, disadvantaging the opposition. The opposition has faced intimidation and harassment (Bauer 2001, 43-51; Africa Confidential 2004a, 7). Before independence, power in SWAPO was concentrated in the hands of Nujoma and a few close allies. SWAPO's security services arrested, tortured, and executed large numbers of SWAPO members suspected of dissidence (Leys and Saul 1994, 127-40). Post-independence, Namibia has adhered to the formal rule of law and democracy, but power remained concentrated in the hands of Nujoma and his inner circle even after his retirement. Challenges to the government from dissatisfied regions in the 1990s were met with human rights violations and government repression (Bauer 2001, 40- 44, 53; Africa Confidential 2007). For these reasons, we code the SWAPO regime as authoritarian."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."

They controlled all executive, legislative, and judicial power. By 1950 the Rana family owned three fourths of the arable land in the country and consumed about half of the state's income (Levi 1952, 185-88; Hayes 1975, 620; Heitzman 1991)."

In response to widespread demonstrations and strikes, President Saibou agreed to the National Conference, which met from July 29 to November 3 1991 (Gervais 1997, 92). It immediately ruled that its decisions would be sovereign, overruling existing institutions. It dissolved the government and ordered the ministries to report directly to it, and it dismissed the army commander. The National Conference chose a transitional government led by a technocrat and a professor, who had not been part of the old regime, to manage the transition to democracy. Fair multiparty elections were held in February-March 1993, and the winners were allowed to take power, completing a transition to democracy (Ibrahim 1994, 29-38; Gervais 1997, 96; Ibrahim and Souley 1998, 148-50; Political Handbook of the World 2012o)."

[The Ironsi government does not appear in the data set because it did not last until January 1.] The military regime that began in July 1966 is treated as different from the earlier military government because of the difference in ethnic base and the rank of the officers involved in the two governments."

"End: 8/26/1993 The military leader, Babangida, was forced to resign. He appointed an un-elected civilian as interim executive after annulling the results of what should have been a transitional election, leaving Gen Abacha as Defense Minister and the real leader of the succeeding regime (Lewis 1999, 144). In November 1993 the civilian resigned in favor of Abacha. Abacha purged Babangida's supporters from the highest government and military offices and changed the informal rules for choosing leaders and policies by eliminating substantial parts of the officer corps from positions of influence. He also eliminated civilian politicians who had been granted some influence as part of the aborted transition process (Associated Press 1993). Abacha relied on groups from his hometown (Economist 1996a). Because of these changes in the identity of those who had access to top leadership roles and influence on policy, the period after August 1993 is considered different from the Buhari/Babangida regime."
Nigeria (1993-99)	"Start: 8/26/1993 General Abacha and his narrow group of military allies replaced the institutionalized military regime led by Babangida. Within a month, Abacha had dismissed and forced into retirement a large number of high ranking officers and narrowed the group with influence and high office to his close military allies and individuals from his home area.

With the previous dynasty weakened by civil war over the succession and poor leadership, in 1741 Ahmed bin Said al Busaidi, governor of Sohar on the coast of what is now of Oman, led the city's defense against a Persian invasion. Although he did not become the formal leader of Oman until 1744 (probably-date of formal election is disputed) when he was named imam, Ahmed bin Said seems to have been the most powerful leader during a very chaotic time beginning in 1741.

Pakistan (1947-58)	"Start: 8/14/1947 At independence, control passed to a government led by Jinnah, who was elected shortly before independence by a Constituent Assembly that had itself been chosen partly by the rulers of the princely states and partly by provincial legislatures chosen in limited franchise elections (Feit 1973, 70; Gauhar 1996, 16). The Constituent Assembly, which also served as the legislature, remained in office for seven years without producing the constitution that would set the rules through which future legislatures would be elected. During that time the executive, the Governor General, continued to function under the rules of the colonial administration, which allowed him to choose and dismiss PMs without consulting the legislature and to dismiss elected provincial governments (Shehab 1995, 201; Gauhar 1996, 25-29). When in 1954 the Constituent Assembly passed a bill requiring the Governor General to choose PMs responsible to parliament, he dismissed it (Shehab 1995, 234-38; Gauhar 1996, 23-24). A new Constituent Assembly was chosen in 1954, again mostly by provincial assemblies, some of which had been intervened by the Governor General (Feit 1973, 70; Asfar 1991, 54). Because of the absence of mass suffrage direct elections for national office, 1947-58 is coded as authoritarian."	"End: 10/27/1958 Coup led by Gen. Ayub Khan ousted the civilian government. On October 7, President Iskander Mirza dismissed the Prime Minister, shut down the Parliament, and declared marital law. On October 27, Ayub Khan ousted Mirza (Feit 1973, 68; Shehab 1995, 246-250)."

"End: 12/20/1971 Yahya Khan turned power over to Bhutto, whose party had won a plurality in West Pakistan - which after December 1971 was all that remained of Pakistan - in the December 1970 parliamentary elections. These universal suffrage, direct elections were considered fair and expected to be transitional, but the Assembly had not been allowed to meet because the Awami League representing East Pakistani aspirations for greater autonomy had won a majority (Mook 1974, 110-11; Shehab 1995, 272-87).

Panama (1949-51)	"Start: 11/24/1949 On this date, the National Guard installed Arias as President. The deposed acting president had tried to dismiss the head of the National Guard. In response, the Guard ousted him and installed Arias, who had been a candidate in the 1948 presidential election, claiming that a recount showed he had won the election (Pippin 1964, 40-57; Major 1993, 271; Pearcy 1998, 138-39). The results of the 1948 election had been intensely contested, with demonstrations, violence, and charges of fraud on both sides, and it is impossible to know now which candidate really won. The electoral board declared Diaz the victor, and he was inaugurated, but died in August 1949 and was succeeded by a constitutional successor who was deposed in November 1949 (Pippin 1964, 21-30). After being installed, Arias tried to change the constitution to lengthen his term, jailed hundreds of opponents, and tried to suspend the National Assembly (Pippin 1964, 69-70; Pearcy 1998, 138-39). So his government would be coded as authoritarian even if he won the 1948 election and had been allowed to take office immediately after it."	"End: 5/10/1951 Arias was ousted by the National Guard, and replaced by his VP, who appointed a multiparty cabinet and oversaw competitive elections in 1952. Arias had been impeached by the elected National Assembly, and the impeachment had been upheld by the Supreme Court, but he refused to step down and shot the one of the officers who came to talk to him about it.

Harassment of the opposition continued from then on, and other legal disadvantages were imposed over time (Pippin 1964, 91-93)."	"End: 1/2/55 Remon was assassinated. Con ict among those who had been his closest supporters led to a split in the CPN, the marginalization of those committed to the rules and policies being established by Remon, and the return to dominance by traditional political elites who had been excluded from influence while he was alive. Remon's term was constitutionally completed by his second vice president, but we code the regime as ending with the assassination because the formal and informal rules defining who could influence policy began changing immediately, leading to a return to democracy the following year.

"End: 3/3/1982 Coup ousted the Commander-in- Chief of the National Guard who had succeeded Torrijos when he died in July 1981. The civilian president chosen by Torrijos was forced to retire a few months later on July 31 1982. The March 3 1982 coup marks a transition from the Torrijos regime, in which both officers in the National Guard and a broad alliance of civilians influenced policy, to a regime based on one faction of the National Guard and a much narrower group of civilians (Kempe 1990, 114-24)."

Stroessner was elected president two months later in a single-candidate election (Roett and Sacks 1991, 53-54; Leon-Roesch 1993, 514)."	"End: 5/9/1993 Competitive election, generally considered free, is coded as the endpoint of a series of democratizing reforms carried out between 1989 and 1993 by the Rodriguez administration. The 1989 election of Rodriguez is not considered transitional because he was a Stroessner regime insider and relative by marriage who had originally achieved office via coup in what Abente Brun (1999, 93) calls "an internal adjustment made by the ruling coalition". The formal and informal rules under which he won the election were very similar to those under which Stroessner had won elections (Abente Brun 1999, 93-94). Beginning in early 1990, however, the Rodriguez government carried out a series of democratizing reforms, e.g. the compulsory party affiliation of officers was ended, the military and police were prohibited from partisan activity, electoral rules that disadvantaged opposition parties were changed to PR, and a new constitution was written (Leon-Roesch 1993, 505; Lambert 2000, 383-85)."

Peru (1962-63)	"Start: 7/18/1962 Coup led by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Perez Godoy, ousted the civilian government in order to prevent the incoming elected government from taking office and installed a military junta (Pike 1967, 302). In the June 1962 presidential election, no candidate had received the 1/3 of votes required to win so the choice went to Congress. Haya de la Torre, APRA's leader, and Odria, the former president and standard bearer for UNO, agreed to a coalition in which Odra would be president and Haya de la Torre's deputy would be vice president (because the military had let it be known that they would not allow Haya to take office). The military ousted the outgoing president in order to prevent the UNO-APRA alliance from taking office, annulled the election, and established a four man junta of the leaders of the services to rule until another election could be held (Pike 1967, 299-300; Kantor 1969, 477; Masterson 1991, 174-77 Klaren 2000, 320)."

Philippines (1972-86)	"Start: 9/22/1972 Elected President Marcos declared martial law: closed Congress, arrested opposition leaders, journalists, congressmen, and student activists, and closed many media outlets. The declaration of martial law is identified as the transition to dictatorship (Grossholtz 1973, 102; Zich 1986, 119-20; Seekins 1991)."	"End: 2/25/1986 Marcos resigned in response to massive demonstrations protesting a stolen election. His resignation allowed the newly elected government to take office (Seekins 1991)."
Poland (1944-89)	"Start: 12/31/1944 Date of establishment of a provisional government, a coalition of leftist parties controlled by the PPR (communist). The provisional government announced on December 31 governed a substantial part of Poland, from which the Soviets had driven German troops. It faced no serious domestic challenges because of the defeat in October 1944 of theWarsaw uprising led by the Home Army. After the Home Army's defeat, Mikolajczyk, premier of the Polish government-in-exile in London, agreed to negotiate with the communists. When other members of the government-inexile refused to support his compromise, he resigned from the government-in-exile. He joined the communist dominated coalition in 1945. Although non-communist leaders held some formally important positions in this and later governments, the communists never lost control. Through their control of the security forces and the Interior Ministry, they assured the repression and disorganization of more popular parties and won the 1947 election (Hiscocks 1963, 87-91, 101-6; Lukas 1982, 4-8, 20-28, 70-75)."	"End: 6/18/1989 The second round of parliamentary elections. In the first and second rounds, the non-communist opposition won nearly all contested seats. Although a majority of the seats had not been contested, the opposition was able to put together a non-communist coalition government (with the first non-Communist PM) by allying with some of the small parties that had historically been coopted into the communistled front. They defected from the front to join the opposition. Consequently, we treat the second round of the election as the regime end date because it led to an elected opposition government (Pease 1992; Inter-Parliamentary Union n.d.b)."
Portugal (1926-74)	"Start: 5/25/1926 Military coup led by Gen Gomes da Costa, who had been selected for leadership by the young officers who organized the plot (Opello 1991, 57)."	"End: 4/25/1974 Coup organized by junior officers, especially those who had served in Africa, ousted the Caetano government and established a provisional government that carried out a transition to democracy.

Romania (1945-89)	"Start: 3/6/1945 The Soviets forced King Michael to appoint Groza, a communist sympathizer, as PM. He in turn appointed a communist dominated coalition government and a communist commander of the armed forces. With control over the police, military, judiciary, communication, propaganda, and public works, the communists consolidated their political control during the next three years. King Michael was forced to abdicate in December 1947 (Van Dyke 1947, 373-78; Sudetic 1993; Tismaneanu 2003, 90-95)."	"End: 12/22/1989 Ceausescu and his wife fled the capital in response to a popular uprising.

Rwanda (1962-73)	"Start: 7/1/1962 Independence under single-party rule by PARMEHUTU, which had been organized to further the interests of the majority Hutu ethnic group. A preindependence popular uprising by Hutus led to armed ethnic conflict, the deaths of tens of thousands, and the flight into exile of more than 100,000 Tutsis. Tutsis were not represented in the government elected in September 1961, before independence, which advocated Hutu supremacy and followed a policy of violent repression against Tutsis (Weinstein 1977, 55-64, U.S. Dept. of State 2011l)."

Saudi Arabia (1927-)	"Start: 5/20/1927 The Treaty of Jeddah in which Great Britain recognized the independence of the Kingdoms of Hijaz and Najd was signed on this date. They were ruled by the monarchy that had been established during the previous 25 years through conquest by Adb al Aziz al Saud, leader of the al Saud family. In September 1932, the kingdoms were formally united under the name Saudi Arabia (Smyth 1992)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Senegal (1960-2000)	"Start: 8/20/1960 Independence from the Mali Federation, under single-party dominance. (The Mali Federation gained independence from France on June 20, 1960.) The BDS (later names BPS, UPS, PS) swept pre-independence elections and coopted most other parties into its organization. Harassment of the remaining opposition began shortly after independence. One opposition party was outlawed in 1960, and several opposition party leaders were arrested. Special tribunals to try political offenses were established in October 1960. The confrontation between Senghor and his PM from December 1962 to January 1963 resulted in the arrest and long prison sentence of PM Dia and consolidated Senghor's individual control over the ruling party (Foltz 1964, 16-63; Klein 1987, 326; LeVine 2004, 204)."	"End: 3/19/2000 The opposition won the second round of a fair presidential election, ousting the dominant-party regime (Vengroff and Magala 2001, 129-62).

Serbia/ Yugoslavia (1991-2000)	"Start: 6/25/1991 We date the beginning of Serbian dominated Yugoslavia to this day when Slovenia declared independence (Prunk 2001). The disintegration of the regime led by the Yugoslav communist party (League of Communists of Yugoslavia) in 1990, followed by the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia in 1991, left the remaining part of Yugoslavia dominated by the Serbian communist party and its leader Milosevic. This marks a change in the identity of the group that could choose policies and personnel. In the prior Yugoslavian political system, Milosevic and the Serbian party were one of several veto players in a collective leadership structure that prevented one man or region from dominating the rest. After the secessions, leadership in the remainder of Yugoslavia narrowed to the Serbian party and especially the group around Milosevic himself. Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded in 1992, further reducing the breadth of the ruling coalition and leaving only Serbia and Montenegro in the reconstituted Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which began its formal life in April 1992 (Sekelj 2000, 63; U.S. Dept. of State 2011m)."	"End: 10/5/2000 Milosevic resigned in response to massive demonstrations, allowing the party that had won the election to take office (BBC News 2000b; Binnendijk and Marovic 2006; U.S. Dept. of State 2011m)."
Sierra Leone (1967-68)	"Start: 3/23/1967 Coup led by Maj Blake ousted Force Commander Brig Lansana, who had seized power from the civilian government two days before to prevent the opposition from taking power after it won an election. [Lansana does not appear in the data set because he was ousted before Jan 1.] Lansana was allied with the dominant faction of the incumbent party and collaborated with incumbent elites in carrying out the coup. The officers who removed Lansana opposed the incumbents. They established a seven-man military junta, the National Reformation Council, suspended the constitution, dissolved all parties, and closed parliament (Bebler 1973, 68-70; Foray 1988, 27)."	"End: 4/18/1968 Non-commissioned officers ousted the military government and installed the MPs who had been elected in March 1967 but were not allowed to take office. Stevens, leader of the largest party, became PM, completing the transition to civilian rule (Fisher 1969, 611; Bebler 1973, 79-80; Foray 1988, 31-32)."
Sierra Leone (1968-92)	"Start: 6/30/1968/ This is the date of the arrest of a few SLPP leaders to prevent them from campaigning in by-elections. The elected Stevens government began incremental steps toward single-party rule immediately after being installed. It annulled by legal petition most of the constituency elections that had been won in 1967 by the former incumbent party, the SLPP, regardless of whether there was evidence of past election rigging. This was done legally, through the courts, and the SLPP had in fact rigged elections in some constituencies in 1967, so we do not code the unseating of SLPP deputies as "authoritarianization." The APC government then used the beneficial and coercive resources at their disposal to insure that the APC won many of the subsequent by-elections. In June 1968, the first SLPP leaders were arrested, and we identify these arrests as the event that tipped the regime from democracy to dictatorship. In November 1968, the government declared a state of emergency and sent troops into the Mende areas of strong SLPP support, where violence had broken out during by-election campaigns. A number of SLPP supporters were killed by soldiers during the ensuing repression. A few seats in SLPP-dominated districts were left vacant because the government claimed that violence precluded holding scheduled by-elections (though they were held in equally violent districts where the APC was expected to win). The SLPP was prevented from holding political meetings and over time repression increased (Africa Confidential 1968b, 7; Cartwright 1968, 29-30; New York Times 1969; Clapham 1972, 83-85; Cox 1976, 208; Allen 1978, 192; Hayward 1984, 25-26, 30; Zack-Williams 1999, 144)."

Kabba returned to Freetown on March 10, 1998 (BBC News 1998)."
Singapore (1965-)	"Start: 8/9/1965 Independence when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Before independence, the PAP led by Lee Kuan Yew won the 1959 and 1963 assembly elections. The elections were competitive, but individuals with records of "subversive activity," that is, pro-communists, a large group including well-known political actors, were not allowed to compete. Throughout the pre-independence period, British actions to limit the influence of the large communist movement aided Lee's dominance over rivals in the PAP and the PAP's dominance over other potential mass-based parties by removing some of the most popular potential political leaders from competition. Thus we do not treat the pre-independence elections as democratic. Before independence, the PAP government arrested 111 "agitators," most from a leftist faction of the party, who had opposed Lee and split from the party prior to the 1963 election, further reducing democraticness. At independence in 1965, Lee Kuan Yew and PAP were fully in control (LePoer 1989; Means 1996, 105). The regime is considered authoritarian despite competitive pre-independence elections because parties and individuals who would have been expected to attract large numbers of votes were prevented from par94 Autocratic regime Start and End events ticipating.

Spain (1939-76)	"Start: 3/28/1939 The fall of Madrid marked the final victory by the nationalist armed forces over forces of the elected Popular Front government. Franco assumed power as the leader of the nationalist forces (Manchester Guardian 1939, Rinehart and Browning 1988a)."	"End: 11/18/1976 The Cortes passed the Political Reform Law, introducing universal suffrage parliamentary elections. They were introduced by the Francoist PM and passed by the legislature elected under the Francoist corporatist system of representation. This change and others introduced at around the same time are considered the end of the Francoist regime. When Franco died in 1975, his handpicked successor, King Juan Carlos, replaced him as head of state and the PM chosen by Franco continued in office, thus continuing the regime brie y. The king, however, replaced the PM with a former Francoist reformer in June 1976, and the latter introduced the reforms that ended the Francoist system. The first fair, direct, universal suffrage election was held in June 1977 (Rinehart and Browning 1988b; Powell 1994, 16)."
Sri Lanka (1978-94)	"Start: 9/7/1978 This date marks the constitutional revision that created an executive presidency with quasi-dictatorial powers, which is treated as the point when the Jayawardene government crossed the line to dictatorship, although government partisans had been assaulting opposition partisans, members of minorities, and union members opposed to government economic policies since their election victory in July 1977 (DeVotta 2002, 91; DeVotta 2004, 143-46). Under the September 1978 constitutional revision, the president was entitled to override, amend or suspend the operation of any law enacted by Parliament, to suspend Parliament, and to expel MPs (Edrisinha and Seevakkumaran 2000, 106). The government used UNP militants to harass and beat supporters of opposition parties with collusion from the police (DeVotta 2004, 143-46). In October 1980, the political rights of the main opposition leader were canceled (Blood 1988). In 1982 a rigged referendum extended the UNP's 2/3 majority in Parliament instead of holding the required election (DeVotta 2001, 91)."

The period from April 1985 to the April 1986 election is coded as a regime rather than an interim period leading to a transition because, although the military rulers said they would oversee a transition, other officers exerted pressure to remain in control of the government, and it was unclear which faction would prevail until the election occurred (Anderson 1999, 14)."	"End: 4/12/1986 Competitive Constituent Assembly elections held from April 1 to April 12 returned power to civilians (African Elections Database 2011l)."

The new rulers dismissed much of the officer corps (Hooglund 1991; Burr and Collins 2003, 2)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Swaziland (1968-)	"Start: 9/6/1968 Independence under the traditional monarchy. Although Swaziland has a parliament and initially held multiparty elections, the royal family's policy decisions and appointments were not constrained by parliament. In 1972 the opposition won in three constituencies, and in response the king declared a state of emergency, dismissed parliament, dissolved all parties, and ruled by decree from 1973-1978. The 1978 constitution banned parties and introduced nomination and indirect election procedures to insure royal control over future parliaments. The 2005 constitution allows direct, non-partisan election of most of the Assembly, but the king still appoints ten of 65 MPs, 20 of 30 Senators, and appoints the government (Baloro 1994, 21-29; Daniel and Vilane 1986, 57; Levin and MacMillan 2003, 1094-95; African Elections Database n.d.b; U.S. Dept. of State 2011o)."

Syria (1946-47)	"Start: 4/17/1946 Independence transferred power to a government chosen by a parliament that had been indirectly elected under rules that limited the participation of some groups. "[V]oters at the first stage had little control over the election of the parliamentary deputies." The regime is coded as authoritarian because of limits on suffrage and indirect elections (Torrey 1964, 65; U.S. Dept. of State 2011p)."	"End: 7/17/1947 The first direct, competitive parliamentary election. Regime insiders agreed to reforms that democratized the oligarchic political system, leading to the loss of control of government by the ruling party (Torrey 1964, 88-101)."
Syria (1949-51)	"Start: 12/19/1949 Coup ousted the army leadership that had returned power to civilians. The 12/49 coup imposed indirect military control over an elected civilian government. The March 1949 coup is not considered the beginning event of this regime because the military faction that took over in March was ousted in June 1949 by a second military coup that oversaw fair elections and a return to democratic rule in November 1949. [The military government that ruled from March to June 1949 does not appear in the data set because it did not last until Jan 1.] After December 1949, elected civilians controlled most aspects of policy, but the military exercised veto power over foreign policy and the choice of officials (Be'eri 1970, 57-64; Haddad 1971, 202-205; McGowan 1987)."	"End: 11/29/1951 Coup ousted the civilian government and replaced it with full military rule. The period after November 1951 is treated as a different regime because military rulers eliminated the civilian allies who had previously held high offices and exercised influence on policies (Torrey 1964, 207-12; Haddad 1971, 211; Finer 1975, 168-69)."
Syria (1951-54)	"Start: 11/29/1951 Coup ousted the civilian government and replaced indirect military rule with direct military rule by decree. The period after November 1951 is treated as a different regime because military rulers eliminated the civilian allies who had previously held high offices and exercised influence on policies, narrowing the ruling group to a faction of the military (Torrey 1964, 207-12; Haddad 1971, 211; Finer 1975, 168-69)."	"End: 2/25/1954 Coup by a faction of the military returned power to the civilians who had been ousted in November 1951 (Haddad 1971, 218; Be'eri 1982, 70-71). They then oversaw a fair and competitive elections in September-October 1954 (Torrey 1964, 244-64; Be'eri 1982, 80)."
Syria (1957-58)	"Start: 2/26/1957 On this date, a number of important opposition leaders, including several MPs, were found guilty of trumped up treason charges despite formal parliamentary immunity, marking the point at which the government crossed the line from democracy to autocracy. "Authoritarianization" occurred incrementally during 1956- 57, as Col Sarraj gradually undermined the elected civilian government. We identify this guilty verdict as the point at which there ceases to be doubt about who exercised power. In May 1957, the government rigged by-elections, further reducing opposition representation (Torrey 1964, 329-31, 352-53). During 1957-58, Syria was ruled by an alliance of the Ba'th, a radical faction of the Nationalist party, Communists, and independents, supported by Ba'thist and Communist factions of the military. The president and PM were civilian Nationalists, and no party dominated the civilian coalition, though the Ba'th was gaining power throughout the period. The military was too factionalized to fully determine events. No single person seems to have been calling the shots during this period, but Col. Sarraj has been identified as the "power behind the throne" (Haddad 1971, 224) and seems to have been more powerful than any other single leader."	"End: 2/22/1958 Syria ceased to exist as an independent country after merger with Egypt as part of the UAR (Torrey 1964, 379-80; McGowan 1987)."
Syria (1962-63)	"Start: 3/28/1962 Coup ousted the civilian government. A coup in September 1961 ended the UAR and returned Syria to independence; the military then oversaw competitive constituent assembly elections in December 1961. The new assembly elected a civilian president, who chose a civilian PM, initiating democratic government. The March 1962 coup was unpopular and the military factionalized, which led to conflict within the military and the establishment of a partly civilian government the month after the coup. The civilian president who had been ousted in March 1962 was returned to office, but the military controlled the make-up of the cabinet and dissolved the parliament, so this period is coded as indirect military rule and authoritarian (Be'eri 1970, 145-48, Haddad 1971, 265-73, McGowan 1987)."	"End: 3/8/1963 Coup by the pro-Ba'thist faction of the military ousted Gen. Zahr al-Din and his civilian allies (Be'eri 1970, 150-53; Haddad 1971, 294; Be'eri 1982, 80)."
Syria (1963-)	"Start: 3/8/1963 Coup led by pro-Ba'thist officers ousted Gen Zahr al-Din's government and its civilian allies (Be'eri 1970, 150-53). The March 1963 coup was led by officers sympathetic to the Ba'th but not actually members. The National Council of the Revolutionary Command set up immediately after the coup contained a minority of Ba'th members, and the first cabinet they chose was half Ba'th. Over the next few months of factional struggle within the new government and within the military, however, most non-Ba'th officers were excluded from leadership and many non-Ba'thist officers and NCOs were purged from the army, leaving the regime dominated by the Ba'thist faction of the military (Be'eri 1970, 156-65; Rabinovich 1972, 49-59; McGowan 1987)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Taiwan (1949-2000)	"Start: 12/7/1949 Chiang Kai-shek declared Taipei the provisional capital of the Republic of China. Nationalist troops, supporters, and financial assets had been moving from the mainland to Taiwan, which was still under nationalist control, for some time. When Chiang's forces were defeated in the last important area they controlled on the mainland, Chiang and his closest supporters fled to Taiwan. It was intended as a temporary refuge while nationalist forces regrouped to take the mainland but quickly became a de facto independent state (Wang 1951; Government of Taiwan 2001; U.S. Dept. of State 2011q)."	"End: 3/18/2000 Competitive election won by the opposition (Niou and Paolino 2003, 721-40)."
Tajikistan (1991-)	"Start: 9/9/1991 Independence with the government controlled by communist leaders in the Supreme Soviet that had been elected in February 1990 (Library of Congress 2007; Hiro 2009, 321)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Tanzania (1964-)	"Start: 4/26/1964 Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar to form Tanzania. In December 1961, Tanganyika (the continental part of what later became Tanzania) became independent under the leadership of TANU, which won the August 1960 pre-independence elections. PM Nyerere was elected president shortly after independence. Tanganyika 1961-64 is considered democratic and thus not included in the data set. Although TANU won every seat in pre-independence elections, opposition was unfettered, and observers considered the election free and fair. In January 1964, a month after Zanzibar's independence, a rebellion ousted the monarchy and brought a repressive autocratic regime led by the Afro-Shirazi Party to power (Zolberg 1968, 82; Political Handbook of the World 2012q, 1411). ASP leaders agreed to union with Tanganyika to buttress their own position in Zanzibar. The union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika consolidated ASP's control over Zanzibar. Irregularities and violence have continued to plague Zanzibari elections (U.S. Dept. of State 2011r). In 1964, TANU's tolerance of opposition also declined. It began to coerce the civil servants and police to join TANU, and citizens had to produce a TANU card to get medical care or crop selling privileges (Burton and Charton-Bigot 2010, 208). The July 1965 constitution made TANU the only legal party on the mainland and the ASP the only legal party in Zanzibar."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Thailand (1944-47)	"Start: 7/26/1944 The PM and regime leader, Supreme Commander Phibun, resigned, at least partly to try to avoid the imposition of post-war reparations because his government had supported the Japanese. Phibun and what had been the military faction of the "People's Party" - not really a party - were replaced by an unelected pro- Allied, mostly civilian faction led by Pridi Phanamyong, the Seri Thai anti-Japanese faction leader and regent, supported by a civilian pro-royalist faction and Navy of- ficers. 1944-47 is treated as a new regime because the group from which leaders were chosen changed from high level army officers before July 1944 to a coalition of civilians and leaders of the Seri Thai, the anti-Japanese partisans. (The army supported the Japanese.) Although the 1946 constitution allowed both legislative houses to be elected, prevented officers from serving in the legislature and government, and legalized parties, all for the first time, the full period from 1944-47 is considered authoritarian because (1) control of the government did not change after the 1946 election; (2) some opposition leaders were arrested and otherwise harassed; and (3) the constitution included limitations on suffrage based on education (Vella 1955, 388- 89; Cady 1974, 114; Chaloemtiarana 2007a, 16-17; Suwannathat-Pian 1995, 188)."

Thailand (1947-57)	"Start: 11/8/1947 coup led by a group of officers forced into retirement by the previous government ousted the civilian government, excluded Seri Thai from influence, and returned the army and Phibun to power. Parliament was dissolved. A new constitution formally gave the king the right to make laws when parliament was out of session, dismiss cabinet members, and appoint senators, who functioned as the legislature until new elections; these functions were really exercised by the Privy Council controlled by the army (Suwannathat-Pian 1995, 164-65; Chaloemtiarana 2007a, 20- 32). In November 1951 military rule was further tightened. The 1932 constitution was brought back, the new legislature (elected in January 1948) was again dissolved, political gatherings were banned, and parties were banned from participating in politics. A national executive council of 9 officers, 3 from each service, was formed. A Senate was appointed as required by the 1932 Constitution, and it acted as the legislature until new elections for half the assembly in 1952. The other half was appointed. 106/123 members of Senate were military or police officers (Chaloemtiarana 2007a, 51-54)."	"End: 9/16/1957 Coup in which Phibun, his civilian allies and the military faction that supported him were ousted by Gen. Sarit, who installed a more narrowly-based military regime (Chaloemtiarana 2007b, 79-80)."
Thailand (1957-73)	"Start: Seizure event: 9/16/1957 Phibun ousted in a coup led by Gen Sarit, who installed a more narrowly based military regime. In October 1958, Sarit and his allies further narrowed the regime: parties and political gatherings were banned, the constitution abrogated; they created the Revolutionary Council (Khana Pattiwat) to rule. The Revolutionary Council proclaimed an Interim Constitution in 1/59 and also appointed a Constituent Assembly to write a new one and act as interim legislature. Of 220 members, 102 were army officers, 26 navy, 24 air force, 18 police, and 50 were bureaucrats. The period from September 1957 to October 1973 included multiple institutional changes, with legislatures created under different rules and later closed, and parties created and later banned (Chaloemtiarana 2007a, 79-80, 96, 186-87). We treat this period as a single regime because the inner circle of decision making was controlled throughout by "a single group of men" who came to power in the September 1957 coup (Bienen and Morell 1974, 11)."	"End: 10/14/1973 Ddemonstrations led to Thanom's resignation and flight into exile. Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Kris refused more violent action against the demonstraters, and the king supported a transition to democracy. The King appointed an interim PM to oversee a democratic transition, and in January 1975 fair competitive elections were held, completing the transition (Bienen and Morell 1974, 11; Elliott 1978, 135)."
Thailand (1976-88)	"Start: 10/6/1976 Military coup established the ruling National Policy Council made up of officers, which suspended the constitution, dissolved the assembly, banned parties, and declared martial law.

Thailand (1991-92)	"Start: 2/23/1991 A bloodless coup established the six-man National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC) made up of all top military commanders to rule, dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution, declared martial law, and appointed an assembly 148 of 292 of whom were serving or retired officers (Bhuchongkul 1992, 313, 319)."	"End: 5/20/1992 In response to massive demonstrations, the king intervened to replace the military PM with a civilian interim PM until new elections in September 1992 (King and LoGerfo 1996, 104; Minorities at Risk Project 2004). In June 1992, the constitution was amended to require the PM to be an elected member of parliament. In September 1992 a competitive election was won by the Democrat Party, completing the transition to democracy."
Thailand (2006-07)	"Start: 9/19/2006 Coup led by the Army Commander-in-Chief: the military abrogated the 1996 constitution, arrested the cabinet, dissolved parliament, banned political activities, and set up the Council for Democratic Reform as ruling body (BBC News 2006; U.S. Dept. of State 2011s)."

Tunisia (1956-)	"Start: 3/20/1956 Independence under the control of Neo-Destour and Bourguiba. Bourguiba and other Neo-Destour party insiders chose electoral rules without consultation, effectively eliminating opposition from the government and Constituent Assembly, which was elected March 25, 1956. Although the government was nominally a constitutional monarchy, Bourguiba and Neo-Destour had full control of decision making from the beginning. The Bey was formally deposed the following year (Moore 1965, 71-75; Anderson 1986, 235)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010.

Turkey (1923-50)	"Start: 10/29/1923 Independence under the control of Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal) and his allies. Ataturk led the armed forces that defeated the Greek occupation army after World War I and forced the other Allied forces to accept Turkish independence. The April 1920 Grand National Assembly called by the nationalist forces elected Ataturk president and in January 1921 declared sovereignty.

Turkey (1957-60)	"Start: 10/27/1957 The rigged October 1957 election is identified as the date when the elected government crossed the line from democracy to dictatorship. The ruling DP won fair elections in 1950 and more-or-less fair ones in 1954, but with its popularity declining, it resorted to vote rigging in 1957. During the months leading up to the 10/57 election, the government gerrymandered districts, limited opposition access to the media, banned public assemblies, outlawed coalitions, and harassed opposition leaders. There were multiple accusations of registration and vote counting fraud after the election. Ballot boxes were moved in preparation for a recount, the building to which they were moved burned before the recount could be started, and all seats in the contested area were awarded to the ruling party, lending further credence to the claims of fraud (Glazer 1995; Tursan 2004, 70-71)."

Uganda (1980-85)	"Start: 12/11/1980 Parliamentary election marred by fraud, violence, and intimidation was won by the UPC, which brought Obote to power again as PM. The last leader of the interim government was a UPC supporter; he dismissed district commissioners - who organized elections on the ground - opposed to the UPC; some opposition candidates were prevented from running, violence and intimidation were widespread so we code the 1980 election as undemocratic (Mutibwa 1992, 141; Political Handbook of the World 2012s, 1480)."

Uruguay (1973-84)	"Start: 6/27/1973 The president, with military support, closed the legislature, which was investigating claims of torture brought against military officers, and empowered the military and police to take whatever measures they deemed necessary, thus completing the "creeping coup" begun the previous year. In April 1972, the legislature agreed to declare a "state of internal war" in response to the Tupamaro guerrillas; this declaration restricted civil rights, allowed civilians to be tried in military courts, and allowed the military to set up detention centers for those accused of political crimes. In February 1973, under military pressure, the elected president agreed to the creation of a National Security Council (Cosena) made up of the commanders of the three branches of the military, an additional officer, and the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Economy, and Foreign Affairs as well as the president, to advise on policy (in effect to institutionalize their informal veto power); he also agreed to replace the Defense and Interior ministers and to allow officers in the dominant faction of the military to purge others insufficiently committed to the anti-subversive campaign (despite the near defeat of the Tupamaros in September 1972). The closure of the legislature completed the military's takeover of policy making, though the elected president remained formally in office until June 1976, when the military forced him to resign (Kaufman 1979, 113-15; Weinstein 1988, 44-50; Jacob and Weinstein 1990; Arceneaux 2001, 185-88). Real power was held by the Junta de Oficiales Generales, made up 18-28 top officers from the three services, which "dominated critical military and government policy decisions" and the Junta de Comandantes en Jefe, the junta of service commanders (Gillespie 1984, 99; Weinstein 1988, 50; Arceneaux 2001, 190)."

Venezuela (2005-)	"Start: 12/4/2005 The legislative election on this date is coded as the last incremental step over the fine line between flawed democracy and electoral authoritarianism. Venezuela's "authoritarianization" was very gradual between August 2004 and December 2005. Although Venezuelan democracy was flawed, with a partisan National Electoral Commission and the manipulation of electoral procedures before August 2004, up until that time, observers considered elections fair. The opposition remained vibrant and was represented in the Assembly and Courts. In August 2004, Chavez won a recall election, also deemed free and fair by international election observers though not by the opposition. Leading up to the recall, the opposition had collected millions of signatures supporting it, as constitutionally required, but the Chavez-controlled National Electoral Commission had blocked the recall until the Supreme Court ruled in favor of holding it. Immediately after Chavez won the recall, the Chavista-dominated Assembly passed a law increasing the size of the Supreme Court and allowing the dismissal of judges by a simple majority Assembly vote. By the end of 2004, Chavistas had full control of the Supreme Court, and the new Supreme Court majority was rapidly dismissing anti-Chavista lower court judges and hiring Chavistas. The government also published a list of those who had signed recall petitions. Human Rights Watch has documented dismissals of tens of thousands from public employment and other jobs because their names were on this list. It also reports petition signers' loss of access to welfare benefits. Laws constraining the media were tightened. The intimidation campaign against "anti-revolutionaries" continued through 2005. When OAS election monitors visited Venezuela shortly before the December 2005 legislative election, they noted that the fingerprint machines used to identify voters could be linked to voting machines and used to identify who voted for the opposition. Given the government's earlier use of signatures on recall petitions to punish opponents, the five largest opposition parties boycotted the election, and only 25 percent of registered voters turned out to vote. European Union election observers criticized the boycott but noted government misuse of media and the excessive presence of troops around polling places on election day. The Chavistas won all seats in the Assembly. For the next five years no opposition voices were represented in any branch of government, and the public voice of the opposition was muted by harassment, intimidation, and occasionally arrest (Degutis 2005, 7; Marcano and Barrera 2007; Holland 2008, 10-11, 25, 36-37; Corrales and Penfold-Becerra 2011, 27, 30)."

Salih (who had been a Major a few weeks earlier) as President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces (Burrowes 1987, 92-93). The post October 1978 regime is considered different from the 1974-78 regime because Salih began almost immediately to change the identity of those who could influence policy. In late 1978 and 1979, he purged important officers, narrowing the faction of the military included in the regime. He brought back to influence sheikhs who had been excluded since 1974 and gave his family and tribe a privileged place in the regime (Burrowes 1987, 94-130). Beginning in 1979, Salih began developing institutions to allow some participation by ordinary citizens (Burrowes 1987, 112-31)."
Yemen (1978-)	"Start: In 7/17/1978 The four-man Presidential Council that led the 1974-78 regime briefly after earlier leaders' assassinations chose Lt-Col Salih as president and commander-in- chief of the armed forces (Burrowes 1987, 92-93). The post-1978 regime is considered different from the 1974-78 regime because Salih began almost immediately to change the identity of those who could influence policy, reducing the military's role and incorporating sheikhs. Beginning in late 1978, he purged important officers, narrowing the faction of the military included in the inner circle. He brought back to influences sheikhs who had been excluded since 1974 and gave his family and tribe a privileged place in decision making, distribution, and command positions in the military (Burrowes 1987, 94-130; Clark 2010, 122). Beginning in 1979, Salih began developing institutions to allow some participation in politics by ordinary citizens (Burrowes 1987, 112-131)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010."
Yemen South (1967-90)	"Start: 11/30/1967 Independence when Britain handed power to the National Liberation Front, one of the two groups that led the insurgency that toppled British rule (Clark 2010, 87; Time Magazine 1967)."	"End: 5/22/1990 Unification of South Yemen with the North ended the existence of South Yemen as a separate nation (Clark 2010, 134-40)."
Yugoslavia (1945-90)	"Start: 3/7/1945 A government dominated by Tito and the communists was established after the defeat of German occupation forces by communist-led Partisans and negotiations between Tito and representatives of the government-in-exile in London. Prior to that date, there were two Yugoslav governments, the Partisans with control of most of the territory and the government-in-exile with international recognition and support from part of the population, especially in Croatia (Petrovich 1947, 508-9; Van Dyke 1947, 375). The March 1945 government included five non-Partisan ministers out of 28, was led by Tito, and controlled by the communists. Constituent Assembly elections were held in November 1945 in which only People's Front candidates could run and in which "collaborators" were barred from voting. The non-communist ministers resigned in protest, and several non-communist parties boycotted the election. It resulted in a communist dominated government led by Tito as PM. The assembly ended the monarchy (Petrovich 1947, 515-18; Sudetic 1990)."	"End: 1/20/1990 The opening of the 14th (extraordinary) Congress of the League of Yugoslav Communists, at which the Yugoslav communist party dissolved itself into its constituent republican parties, in effect ending one-party rule in Yugoslavia. In February 1990, Slovenia and Croatia legalized opposition parties. The opposition won multiparty elections in Slovenia and Croatia in April-May 1990, which ended communist rule in them; both countries stopped contributing taxes to the central government and withdrew troops from the central government's military operations in Kosovo (Lampe 2000, 352-55; Glaurdic 2011, 127-39). The Slovenian parliament declared full sovereignty in July 1990, and in the same month a constitutional reform in Serbia legalized opposition parties and defined it as defacto independent (Glaurdic 2011, 165). Although the first breakaway countries did not become formally independent until 1991, the Yugoslav League of Communists and the central government lost control of policy making in January 1990 and had lost control of most of what had been Yugoslavian territory by the end of 1990."
Zambia (1967-91)	"Start: 2/28/1967 We identify February 1967 as the time when the UNIP-dominated government crossed the fine line between democracy and dictatorship: "widespread intimidation and violence by ruling party (UNIP) activists" led to victories for it in the February 1967 by-elections called to replace MPs who had split from UNIP to form a new opposition party and whose mandates had then been revoked (Tordoff and Molteno 1974, 23). Further violations of opposition political rights occurred during the following couple of years. In the first half of 1968, prior to the December 1968 general election, a number of UP supporters were beaten or stoned by UNIP youths and some houses were burned (Rasmussen 1969, 414). In August 1968, the UNIP government banned the opposition UP and arrested most of its leaders (Molteno and Scott 1974, 156, Tordoff and Molteno 1974, 27). A number of ANC (the traditional opposition) candidates were prevented from filing their nomination forms prior to the 12/68 election by UNIP roadblocks and local violence (Molteno and Scott 1974, 164). The 1968 election was thus not free and fair."	"End: 10/31/1991 Election was won by the opposition (Bjornlund et al. 1992, 405-31; African Elections Database 2011n)."
Zambia (1996-)	"Start: 5/28/1996 We treat the date the president signed into law the constitutional amendment that prevented the most important opposition candidate (Kaunda) from running for the presidency as the point at which the MMD's repeated small violations of democratic norms crossed the line from democracy to authoritarianism. International and domestic observers also noted a number of other irregularities in the conduct of the November 1996 election, and it was generally criticized as not free and fair (Baylies and Szeftel 1997, 122; Mbao 1998, 1-2, 6; Political Handbook of the World 2012v, 1610)."	"End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010. [MMD's Rupiah Banda lost the September 20, 2011 election to Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front, leading to a transition to democracy.]"
Zimbabwe (1980-)	"Start: 4/18/1980 Independence under the rule of ZANU and Mugabe. The February 1980 pre-independence election that brought ZANU and Mugabe to power is not considered fair by most observers because of the widespread violence and intimidation of non-white voters by ZANU fighters and activists. Violence against dissidents has continued ever since (Kriger 2003, 311; Norman 2004, 84-87, 95-96)."	End: Regime continued in power as of December 31, 2010.
